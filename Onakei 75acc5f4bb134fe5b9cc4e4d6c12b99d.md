# Onakei

Tags: Belt of Water, Fellintra

The Onakei are a tropical sea-borne people descended from [Elementian](Elementian%208e75da99a0c04701a3154f15663d11f8.md)  [Gnome](Gnome%20ba19298cf2754c99a3cc46dc98eb5762.md)s that are believed to have lived in the Elemental belt of water.

As befits their ancestry, the onakei are short, lean, have blue skin, and thick green-bluish hair, which they fashion into rope-like dreadlocks.

They are organized into tribes, which are themselves groups of allied clans. Each clan claims descent from a legendary hero of old, whose powerful souls are thought to still inhabit and effect the material realm. No one knows the origins of the tribes, but it is understood that each tribe owns a small island or land in [Fellintra](Fellintra%208a284461caa445f9a1c30e2b1477f45e.md).

War among the tribes is frequent, and land is sometimes exchanged, but dramatic shifts are unheard of, as the Onakei believe that the tribal system is one of the things keeping the universe together

Hunting, gathering, tribe and family are the central pillars of an Onaâ€™s life. They are often loyal and optimistic, and very capable of handling themselves on the sea and coast.

Onakei are also famously superstitious and backward. The origins of their beliefs and customs are all traced to legendary stories, the origins of which no one knows. To an ona, the world is full of powerful spirits and powerful entities, above and beyond [The Twelve (Gods)](The%20Twelve%20(Gods)%207e8a666a7f414fde89581346a9da8da2.md) that the rest of the worlds worship. 

### Kite Surfring

The Onakei, have developed a very simple method of moving quickly and fighting on the waters of Fellintra. They build very strong but lights kites attached to a thin rope, which in turns ends with a wooden handle. They tend tie their feet to a polished wooden board, which allows them to surf on the surface of the water by being pulled by a wind kite.
