# Manifesta Manae

Tags: Crafting, Extremely Rare

This entire scripture is written in [(Law)ÿ£ÿØŸÇ ŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑŸÖ]((Law)%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%AF%D9%82%20%D9%84%D8%BA%D8%A9%20%D9%81%D9%8A%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%206fb34ee4ab4642f99c359d3bb9eeb568.md) and penned by an unnamed [Arbiter](Arbiter%2065590b0d50694f6b91925a2bc1156e2b.md). The comprehension of this writing requires a very strong academical knowledge of crafting, smithing, arcane theories and a masterful amount of mana manipulation ability and knowledge.

*While the world at large has been accustomed to use [Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md) to create magical items or devices. The knowledge of how [Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md) is made has been lost to the ages and the theory that an ancient race that lived in the planes ([Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) People) millennia ago had this knowledge and knowhow, is now widely accepted in all academia.*

*Through a length, painful and expensive process the [Arbiter](Arbiter%2065590b0d50694f6b91925a2bc1156e2b.md) people have managed to reverse engineer this process. This book outlines the process needed to process [Mana](Mana%201f975a22781a80e9a558ce2099c985da.md) into a its physical embodiment, that is, [Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md).*

*This process requires an extreme degree or skill and also very specific tools and resources. A quite complex addendum with this scripture is written in the sign of a warning.. ‚ÄòThis book is the property of the [Arbiter](Arbiter%2065590b0d50694f6b91925a2bc1156e2b.md) Government in [J**udicium (**Plane of Law)](Judicium%20(Plane%20of%20Law)%2046f3842e3c1c42628e25965fffd97b07.md). It is imperative that if found,  it should be properly and immediately destroyed.‚Äô*

This extremely rare book has been closely guarded by the [Arbiter](Arbiter%2065590b0d50694f6b91925a2bc1156e2b.md) people and if the people of Aeternum at large find these techniques, it is impossible to fathom what would happen if people knew that they could create magical devices or equipment without having to rely on a depleting resource such as [Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md).
