# Spiralling Woods

Type: Area
Continent/Zone: Valkoria
Country/Region: Lycia
World/Realm: Runaria
Plane: Prime Material Plane

This dark green forest is heavily steeped in the Magic of [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md). The great forest trees grow in spirals, some twisting and bending into each other as if embracing. 

Magic is clearly involved in making this happen, but nobody understands the origin. Even the clerics of [Foristra (Goddess of Nature)](Foristra%20(Goddess%20of%20Nature)%20228c4ae2b832446cbf62058bf1fbcb16.md) could not explain this.
