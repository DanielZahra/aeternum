Tags: History

A story of a [Ebony Leaf ‘Raven’](Ebony%20Leaf%20%E2%80%98Raven%E2%80%99%2010b75a22781a80cd8c54e2e2c83f66fb.md) a [Vulkris](Vulkris%2012dd0b6e6e514467ae08b5c2c15eaf3b.md) Hero who fought to the death against the dragon known as the ‘White Death’.

Raven was a hero to the people of [Stormreach](Stormreach%20ef8163d9051b4816983d9b716c7da1ed.md) in his time. Raven was from the village of [Howlcrest](Howlcrest%20332eac8a6dc1479da57f61a0b0f6b116.md) and spent most of this time teaching swordmanship and the teaches of the [The Twelve (Gods)](The%20Twelve%20(Gods)%207e8a666a7f414fde89581346a9da8da2.md).

Around the year 2520 , [Stormreach](Stormreach%20ef8163d9051b4816983d9b716c7da1ed.md) was under attack by a cult of [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md)s that worshipped a corrupted [Dragon](Dragon%205d2dce5311ee4704a379b80b880b5f25.md), that terrorized the region. The dragon was called ‘The White Death’ due to its affinity with water and ice magic.

### The White Death

The White Death was believed to originally be a [High Draconian](High%20Draconian%2083942692fba74247bf1e53cc21847ffa.md) Woman with noble descent. She was infatuated with [Beastkin](Beastkin%209d4322a60f6c4f839ef527a292b33535.md) people, infatuation turned into obsession which eventually led her down the corrupted road of the dragons. 

She terrorized Stormreach for a long time, and this attracted a large number of Dragon Worshippers who formed a cult.

The White Death as a Dragon left many victims especially those travelling the already dangerous roads of Stormreach. Massive white wings, accompanied by frigid breath that turns skin to frost-burn. 

### Heroes of Stormreach

A group of men and women from the north of [Stormreach](Stormreach%20ef8163d9051b4816983d9b716c7da1ed.md) grouped together and went to hunt the dragon. The leader of this group was [Ebony Leaf ‘Raven’](Ebony%20Leaf%20%E2%80%98Raven%E2%80%99%2010b75a22781a80cd8c54e2e2c83f66fb.md).

Within a month, the brave people of [Stormreach](Stormreach%20ef8163d9051b4816983d9b716c7da1ed.md) had defeated the cultist but the dragon remained.

In a final confrontation, it is said that that when most of the people had perished to the dragon, [Ebony Leaf ‘Raven’](Ebony%20Leaf%20%E2%80%98Raven%E2%80%99%2010b75a22781a80cd8c54e2e2c83f66fb.md) defeated the dragon in single combat but died to exhaustion within hours. The handful of survivors returned with the story and [Ebony Leaf ‘Raven’](Ebony%20Leaf%20%E2%80%98Raven%E2%80%99%2010b75a22781a80cd8c54e2e2c83f66fb.md) alongside the rest of the group were named heroes of Stormreach.

A few years later, Raven was named a Saint of the Twelve and a sword monument was built in his name.
