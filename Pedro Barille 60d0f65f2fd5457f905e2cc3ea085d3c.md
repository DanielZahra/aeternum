### Appearance and Personality

While being a peaceful man, Pedro has been down to beat down and bash some skills when necessary. His size and strength more than make up for his lack of training in fighting.

### **Relationships and History**

When the Ditch was burned down by [Florina De Fonseca](Florina%20De%20Fonseca%20857fc3a6d5fa45e6ad0b12519d0264b1.md) and her Guards, Pedro’s Bakery survived but most of the people moved out.

He temporarily moved that the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) ‘s Coffee shop to help the people in need in that area.

Through out the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md), Pedro took a ‘seat’ in [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) council mainly to make sure to protect the people of the city. Having seen the change in [Marcus Steeljaw](Marcus%20Steeljaw%2085d3a81781fd4875b63130eac6d909ad.md) and [Klotan V Duskember](Klotan%20V%20Duskember%2099cdd29b24f847adb6a08e08f487b1d3.md) coming in with more knowhow about leadership Pedro slowly stepped away and returned to his bakery a proud man. He is still preparing large portions of bread of food for the poor of the city and there is never a day where his bakery’s chimney is not running.
