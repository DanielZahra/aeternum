Ajax

### Summary

A young Aezatan, when their war with the gods started taking a turn for the worst, he was one of the chosen to be set into hibernation and eventually save them.

This plan came late and was experimental at best, every was done out of desperation. He was hidden in 'Modern' Valkoria along with 7 others, unfortunately, the plan didn't work well, and they had to sacrifice each other to keep their magic running.  

Luckily for Ajax, a group of adventurers known as the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) happened to find him before his expiry or death.

### Appearance and Personality

His memories are fractured and it will take time to recover and heal. He did come about in a new world thousands of years late.

### **Relationships and History**

He Befriended the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) and found himself mingling and trusting the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) in his stay within Bellmark’s Landing.

The [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) asked Ajax to study their ways of life and absorb as much as possible before his traces were erased so that nothing could find him.

Ultimately he would like to find the other groups of Aezatans that went through the same process, but first, he must establish a foothold in the world and make sure to be safe.

After many months of traveling and studying the cultures and history of this ‘new’ world Ajax, alongside the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) managed to bring forth an [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) that had already been living in the world, one called Adam, also known as the Vermillion Emperor, when he was alive.

Having been reunited with a fellow [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) Ajax is set on a new journey to slowly revive or bring back his brethren alongside [Adam, Vermillion Emperor](Adam,%20Vermillion%20Emperor%201fea2934606a4cfba108aef2a65405f9.md).
