### Summary

This section of the jungles of Fellintra is known to be a no-man land and not meant for life. After the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md) , this zone was the place of a lot of cosmic fighting, death and horrors. The fighting corrupted this piece of the [Evergreen Glade](Evergreen%20Glade%20e1e3cc564e8d4b8b8878f8e367cee2be.md) and most people do not want to step anywhere near. Some people worry that itâ€™s slowly growing and those that live close by monitor the situation with great care. Precious few actually have been in the [Starfall Enclave](Starfall%20Enclave%204f3447db194c4256b7e5351cfdf8cf25.md) and came out alive and none of them got to the core of it. 

The lush forests of the Evergreen Glade, are churned into a purple-ish mass of mutated trees and soil. The core of this corruption is a crashed meteorite from the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md), the meteorite  is believed to be one of the vessels the [Psionic](Psionic%208302f0efd60244b1be7a22191f32ac32.md)s used to travel in the [Astral Plane](Astral%20Plane%20f9ded4fd5e784cab88623297a7302d3f.md). It is clear that some activities and creatures are still alive in the [Starfall Enclave](Starfall%20Enclave%204f3447db194c4256b7e5351cfdf8cf25.md), but they are mostly left alone.

### Notable Places

- In the western area of the [Starfall Enclave](Starfall%20Enclave%204f3447db194c4256b7e5351cfdf8cf25.md), there is a massive abandoned tree that was the home of the Archer Clan, a group of Astronomers, who were the first to discover the Psionic Invasion as they spent a good chunk of their time studying the stars, unfortunately this did not help them avoid destruction of their home as they got invaded. The tree, is now a massive home for [Grogak](Grogak%205cc2ad6e9a7b441e84c279bb87522e73.md).
- The eastern side of the [Starfall Enclave](Starfall%20Enclave%204f3447db194c4256b7e5351cfdf8cf25.md) is dotted with tiny villages that at some point must have been the original homes of some of the [Onakei](Onakei%2075acc5f4bb134fe5b9cc4e4d6c12b99d.md) tribes.
- The central part of the [Starfall Enclave](Starfall%20Enclave%204f3447db194c4256b7e5351cfdf8cf25.md) has an active psionic home, but since there seems to not be much interfacing with the outside world, they have been left alone for centuries, probably not by choice.
