# House Goldleaf

Tags: Queendom of Nya'Tallin, Valkoria

House Goldleaf is an extremely old family that predates the Valkorian Sunstriker and the split on the continent of Valkoria. They are a wealthy family of musicians and instrument makers whose life's work was to build [Duztar’s Step](Duztar%E2%80%99s%20Step%20186ea4cd71c447149950d98abcc3fc92.md).

Deeply involved in politics and masquerades, they made a lot of enemies. The head of the family during [Valkorian Sunstriker](Valkorian%20Sunstriker%20022238d5c0024e84a1aa88a05af19c06.md)'s reign was [Milena Goldleaf](Milena%20Goldleaf%20a8fb20aa07314eafb1a906c1cb0a9e8b.md), who lost favor with the conqueror and thus the family was almost erased from existence.

Being a close ally to [House Mavis](House%20Mavis%20328ee681854044d490cbd4510b8719f6.md) saved them, and within a couple of centuries, House Goldleaf was reinstated as a noble house in the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md) and the rightful owners of Duztar's Step.
