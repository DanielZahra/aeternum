### Summary

Boris usually doesn't share much about himself or his past, except when he's trying to teach new members of the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md) something about the job. 

He’s the father of Varris, (a member of the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md)). 

### Appearance and Personality

Always draped in black clothing and secretive, Boris does not seem like a man anyone would want to mess with.

### **Relationships and History**

Boris, has led the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md), to get mixed up in a secret mission for the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) with ended with the capture of the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md) ‘s prince's capture and eventual execution which spiralled the region into some chaos.

As the Palantine Empire roiled in the 6th Valkorian War, Boris earned the position of Shadowblade, which allows him to perform the machinations necessary to pit many people against each other and manipulate the war from the shadows.

Ultimately, this allowed [Boris Blackmantle](Boris%20Blackmantle%20f8d522d93e3446c8929afd9b5dea421b.md) to indirectly send the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) to hunt down and kill [Draco Palantine](Draco%20Palantine%20a13f23282dc5412f903101a7e1104612.md) and kill him to end the war but mainly to vacate the seat of the Ebonmaster which he was ready to snatch for himself.
