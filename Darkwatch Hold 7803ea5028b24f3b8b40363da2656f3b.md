Plane: Prime Material Plane

### Summary

Darkwatch Hold lies in [Kas’Velar](Kas%E2%80%99Velar%20476c9e227f2443eca550f0ab8be45af5.md) ,  on the frontier between the [Thundersnow Tundra](Thundersnow%20Tundra%206fe57e3d5f6e4f33b5a09d52643ab212.md)  and the Shadow Lands. This bastion of hope stands between the marching hordes of undead swarming out of the Shadow Lands and the rest of the continent. Warriors of all kinds, go there to spend their life fighting and eventually meet a honourable death in combat at the [Wall of Bones](Wall%20of%20Bones%2022875a22781a80448a68dd85b1c11508.md) or beyond. While most of the barbarian clans and tribes of Kas'Velar fight each other constantly, tribes and warriors of Darkwatch Hold, focus their strength on watching the Valley of Bones

The warrior clans share leadership of Darkwatch, the current Tribe or Clan leading Darkwatch are the 'Karoq Urkhaz' aka Deathbringers in Orcish. In turn, the Deathbringers have their Chieftain and High-Shaman.

The Hold is built to defend and not attack as every attempt to go further into the Shadow Lands has been a catastrophic failure. The hold has moved location several times but retained its name.

### Prisoner’s Last Home

Darkwatch Hold has had a long tradition of prisoners coming from every corner of Aeternum. These prisoners are given weapons, armor and allows to work and live a regular life as long as they remain within Darkwatch Hold’s area and help fight the armies of undead. For some this is better than execution or rotting in a prison. However, precious few survive more than a few months..

- **Black Battle Forge**
    - Where weapons and amour for the fighters are made. This forge never shuts down and people are constantly working.
    - It’s called the Black Battle Forge as it’s completely covered in soothe from the thousands of weapons made and coal burnt.
