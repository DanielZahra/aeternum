# Fiendspawn

Scorned and avoided by most people, those unlucky enough to be born as a Fiendspawn donâ€™t have easy lives. Families that made pacts with fiends see these children born in their bloodline more often than others. However, pristine families have also seen Fiendspawn children be born in their lineages. Some believe that sometimes the Soul Cycle plays a cruel joke and allows for a person to be born with Fiendish qualities.

Due to them regularly being bullied, abandoned or outright killed, a lot of Fiendspawn tend to not live the best of lives and often have to stay on the move. Only a lucky few get to live how they want.

All Fiendspawn carry the genetics of their original species but their looks are heavily modified with fiendish qualities. Fiendspawn can resemble their parents in most ways, but they will always carry fiendish qualities, such as horns, tails, pointed teeth, skin colors etc. (A Fiendspawn born of a [Dwarf](Dwarf%207b5851a6b05341bcb4d77736f736b8f8.md) family, will still be a dwarf in many ways but have Fiendish looks).
