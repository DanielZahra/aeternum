# Copper Rats

Tags: Palantine Empire

A ‘thieves’ guild is run by a philanthropist group, their goals are kept secret and they don't reveal what they're going to do good to protect the common people. Large numbers of urchins and beggars claim to be part of the rats which swells their perceived size. This also makes it very difficult to track them down. 

They steal from some of the rich and corrupt people, making that war plans from all countries don’t make it to their destinations so maybe they can stop large wars from erupting.

Of course, this doesn't mean they don't have their own problems and they still are breaking the laws. Now all their members are as altruistic as the idea behind the Rats is.

They have been at odds with the Blood Coin Creed and the Ebon Syndicate.

The rats originated from the centre of Valkoria in the city of Bellmark’s Landing where they created a base in under a baker's shop.
