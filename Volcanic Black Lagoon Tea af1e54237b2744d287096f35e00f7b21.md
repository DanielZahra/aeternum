# Volcanic Black Lagoon Tea

Tags: Black Lagoon, The Dragon Lands

A very strong black tea made from leaves extracted from the volcanic plants in the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md). This tea is brewed at very high temperatures as the leaves are very resistant to heat.

The taste is soothing for the soul and gives a very warm sensation for a few hours after consumption. The strong taste is very reminiscent of [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) cuisine, so it might be a bit too strong for those with a light stomach.
