### Summary

A shady figure that has been known to take on dark jobs for the syndicate. He embodies the green and ruthlessness of the Syndicate very well.

### **Relationships and History**

He was present in [Vakkengard (Titan’s Rest)](Vakkengard%20(Titan%E2%80%99s%20Rest)%20b8c329549abf41648464107b78a72b2a.md) when the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) took out a tribune of the empire. He and his team did not get involved and seemingly walked away without a scratch as their employer died.

[Viktor Meroni](Viktor%20Meroni%209d1a29d6609548dbb34f96ed1bb530ab.md) kept close contact with [Varris Blackmantle](Varris%20Blackmantle%205225eea635564ec3816e33dd88758d06.md) and subsequently [Boris Blackmantle](Boris%20Blackmantle%20f8d522d93e3446c8929afd9b5dea421b.md), he was a big part of the coup within the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md). At the end of it, Boris awarded him the role of Shadowblade. He is now working within the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md).
