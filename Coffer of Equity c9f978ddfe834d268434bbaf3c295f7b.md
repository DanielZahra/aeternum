# Coffer of Equity

Tags: Universal

This bank was started by a group of Gnomes that could not carry their belongings with them along the tunnels of Cerulia and needed to access everything they owned remotely.

They employ very accurate and specialized magic to deposit the customer's belongings into an extraplanar storage, the customers are given a code and as long as they know this code and also provide a tiny blood sample they can access their 'Coffer'. With this magic they can use the banks across the plains and their belongings will always be within reach.

Every single bank employee or representative is highly trained in their job and also takes a great measure of security. They also have a system that allows a client to leave a will behind and the bank would move the belonging between accounts. If someone does not pick up their belonging in over two centuries the bank will confiscate them.

The bank makes its money by charging interest rates and also giving loans out to trusted clients. The interest rate for clients is known to vary and usually, those with very little don't need to pay much, however using the bank's services incurs a 50 gold charge for a transaction.
