### The Titan War

Modern society doesn't have more information about what happened to the ancient titans, the answer to this question remains with the Azaetans. As they lived in the same world, the Titans and the Azaetans lived in harmony.

It is said that the Gods went to war against the Azaetans and over hundreds of years of brutal fighting, the Azaetans lie broken and divided. However when the Azaetans learnt that the titans could be harvested for their power and said power might match the gods, the war was extended and became more brutal. This lead to the gods to destroy the Azaetan Dynasty in almost its entirety. As if that were not enough, the gods broke the soul of all dead Azaetans so they would not be reborn in the cycle.

Following this brutality and destruction, gods changed the worlds for more balance creating the planar realms and races, slowly over thousands of years.
