### History

After being abducted by [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md)’s forces and kept as a prisoner in [Argentcourt](Argentcourt%20b41a9e66f343460486a277b32660228c.md), it was clear that working with [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md) was not an option. At the [End of the Sixth Valkorian War](End%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%20baaa265f20174631be11e4821e2552ba.md), both [Stefanos Lightseeker](Stefanos%20Lightseeker%20c1f3e3aeb4b64f23b01036e85a984da6.md) and [Alekos Lightseeker](Alekos%20Lightseeker%20e88632a005164453b65ab549e06ec1ad.md) moved to [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) with [Calliope Lightseeker](Calliope%20Lightseeker%200d801d6e7a9e48979700aa3b30c2462d.md) and [Astellios Lightseeker](Astellios%20Lightseeker%209df94ac6f30949a69dd6c024e821df50.md). They joined the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) and started working to build a new observatory to spread the teaches of Astrology and Atromancy to the people of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md). Eventually moved to [Dawnsreach](Dawnsreach%20761cae0d1e6a43e2ae73a08f7d6fc2ce.md) to continue their work there and make it their new home.

Stefanos grew to respect his youngest son, [Astellios Lightseeker](Astellios%20Lightseeker%209df94ac6f30949a69dd6c024e821df50.md) way of doing things and experiencing the world and opened his eyes to be less conservative.

He became the defacto High-Astromancer in the Observatory in [Dawnsreach](Dawnsreach%20761cae0d1e6a43e2ae73a08f7d6fc2ce.md).
