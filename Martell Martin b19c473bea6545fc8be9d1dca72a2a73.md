He was sick and tired of [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md) ‘s experiments and he wanted to leave. He stole some supplies and documents and made a run for it.

He was chased all the way to Bellmark's Landing escaping a group of Shikari. He temporarily joined the [Copper Rats](Copper%20Rats%2080dc3a7e773e4b7f97ceadc9f93ace8c.md) and made a living, but also managed to burn downa couple of buildings and became a wanted man.

Following which the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md), took a job to capture him, which they did but instead of turning him into the authorities or the Lycian Skihari, they saved his life and listened to his story and agreed to work with him.

As he spent more time with the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md), [Martell Martin](Martell%20Martin%20b19c473bea6545fc8be9d1dca72a2a73.md) decided that he wanted to do more good in his life and joined the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) and devoted a lot of time and energy helping out the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) and [Shi-rai Igarashi](Shi-rai%20Igarashi%202b00fac466024354b0273317d2e43ca0.md) carve out a new base within [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md). As the Quills traveled to [Valkorian’s Seat](Valkorian%E2%80%99s%20Seat%20eb373989a5ab4abcaae4c4f0264b3656.md), Martell joined [Radegundh V Duskember](Radegundh%20V%20Duskember%20ac0c23e3ded6497fb008f10fc5232fbc.md) and [Flake of Snow](Flake%20of%20Snow%200acbb6e796964907a336f61d1c3903dd.md) and used his fiery powers to burn the Forgotten plaguing the island.
