Tags: Knowledge, Religion

This book penned by priests of [Graav (God of Death)](Graav%20(God%20of%20Death)%20d63b83eee74f4e1c9db355255ee1a0a0.md), describes the process and sacrilege performed at the [Evergreen Glade](Evergreen%20Glade%20e1e3cc564e8d4b8b8878f8e367cee2be.md) when priests of Graav used a mass ritual to bring the dead back to life. 

The book attempts to theorize and guess what happened in the event and how such a thing is even possible as no known knowledge can revive so many people, a price must be paid.
