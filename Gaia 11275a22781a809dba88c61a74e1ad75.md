Gaia was originally one fo the worlds of the [Prime Material Planes](Prime%20Material%20Planes%2020a880ed277044b892497e01fd27933b.md). According to speculation and undocumented history, Gaia was the main home of the [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) people. This is where they flourished before moving and inhabiting the other plants of the prime.

When the [The Titan War](The%20Titan%20War%204b93790f498a457a9172f0b2adb5afc6.md) began, legend has it that [Graav (God of Death)](Graav%20(God%20of%20Death)%20d63b83eee74f4e1c9db355255ee1a0a0.md) himself, tore the planet to shred draining the life out of it. This act also unfettered the planet from the other prime plans and now it floats as a husk of a planet between [Tenebrium (Plane of Darkness)](Tenebrium%20(Plane%20of%20Darkness)%207718024e47414800b2c2b6077c344e7d.md) and [Pandemonium (Plane of Chaos)](Pandemonium%20(Plane%20of%20Chaos)%20375249c38c0c4dc39d6cd24993a3eb35.md).
