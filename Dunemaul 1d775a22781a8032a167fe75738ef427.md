# Dunemaul

Tags: Dragon
Creature Family: Behemoths, Dragons

### Summary

These draconic behemoths can run unimpeded through sands. They have an innate ability to breathe inwards and draw up sand from the ground, and then spit it forward mixed in with very stuck saliva which create a restraining net, allowing the Dunemaul to trap itâ€™s prey.

Dunemauls are mainly feared for their saliva turning bodies into stone.
