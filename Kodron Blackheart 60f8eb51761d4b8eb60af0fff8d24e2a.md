### Summary

Kodron is a Draconian born and raised on the Black Lagoon, a Harsh lifestyle which produced strong people. He’s a seer of his people and his charge is to retell the Legend of the Vermillion Dragon and teach the other Draconians the history of the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md) 

The Legend of the Vermillion Dragon mentioned that once upon a time when the dragon lands still had an emperor, a particularly strong emperor known as the Vermillion King left a legacy in writing (which now has been lost). The story says that he will never be gone and those who inherit his power and come together will bask in his full power's glory at get a chance to be as strong as the emperor himself.  Throughout history several people tried to find others, but as far as they know very few people have even found anyone.

### Appearance and Personality

This green-scaled shelled-draconian seems like a tough older man. He has an eye patch which visible scars underneath. Embedded in his chest is what seems to be a volcanic rock with seared skin around it. Soon after his birth he was involved in an accident and he ended up with a piece of hot rock embedded in him. Somehow he survived and ever since he was very strong in the affinity of magic with Lava.

### **Relationships and History**

After meeting the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) and agreeing to accompany them on their journey to discover more about the Vermillion King’s legend. The party was met by [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md). A deal was made so that [Kodron Blackheart](Kodron%20Blackheart%2060f8eb51761d4b8eb60af0fff8d24e2a.md) would accompany Maev until Valkoria’s situation was under control. The [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) were not happy with the outcome but they believed it would be the best for everyone to antagonize the Archmagus.

Having accompanied [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md) and also helped her fulfill the prophecy and participate in the vermillion ritual left [Kodron Blackheart](Kodron%20Blackheart%2060f8eb51761d4b8eb60af0fff8d24e2a.md) fulfilled, but also empty as both [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md) and [Brand](Brand%20607d655e23dd44bd8e867a910c8172cf.md) had a major disagreement where [Brand](Brand%20607d655e23dd44bd8e867a910c8172cf.md) took the power of the Emperor for himself and lost control. 

Nobody has seen [Kodron Blackheart](Kodron%20Blackheart%2060f8eb51761d4b8eb60af0fff8d24e2a.md) since the battle in [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md).
