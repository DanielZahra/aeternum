# Vakkengard (Titan’s Rest)

Type: Village
Continent/Zone: Valkoria
Country/Region: Valkorian City-States
World/Realm: Runaria
Plane: Prime Material Plane

### Summary

Known for its 'Titan Bones' and great fruits, this village is a small but tight community of people. The skeletal bones that remain of what would have been a massive titan are an attraction to many scholars. So the people of this village get their fair share of visitors.

The land around the bones is extremely fertile and produces some of the best fruit available in the region. Some believe this is due to the titan dying in the area as it made the soil extremely rich.

### Notable Places

- **The Titan's Rib**
    - The obvious thing that makes this village stand out more than any other village and why it sees some traffic is the titan's rib that the village is built around.
    - A good number of scholars or visitors just come here for the bone and nothing else, but this is a good thing as they do pay for staying and sometimes leave some knowledge behind.
- **Pier**
    - Vakkengard sometimes gets small sailing ships that move between the Empire and the Queendom, they do trading round trips but also serve as transportation. The stop here is short and often skipped.
- **Apotecharia Titannica**
    - This small study and shop are set up very close to the bones.
    - They sell books, trinkets, and do-dads, and also meddle in the alchemical properties of the bone.
    - The books sold here are free to peruse and use by the locals, the owner lets them read and learn for free.
- **Titan Fields**
    - The farmland around the Titan's body is why people settled here, it's very fertile and from the divinations on the land it was revealed that this is probably because of the Titan's dead body, as it 'fed' the land.
- **Golden Princess: Tavern**
    - **Owned by [Spear of Dragons](Spear%20of%20Dragons%20c39795885b1e4c4c8c1eea002599c07d.md)**
    - The tavern is a timber-framed and large single-story building, with a grey shingled roof and softly blowing wind-chimes by the door. It contains large high-quality rugs on the floor and a poker table.
- **Randal's General Store**
    - The general store is a wooden and large single-storey building, with a brown tile roof and overgrown hedges. A parrot serves as a mascot and greets customers. They have barrels full of bulk food.

### History and Events

On the 15th of July 3213, the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) infiltrated Vakkenbgard which was housing a Legion of Empire soldiers under the command of Tribune Massimo Colombo. The army was there to force [Klotan V Duskember](Klotan%20V%20Duskember%2099cdd29b24f847adb6a08e08f487b1d3.md) to leave Bellmark’s Landing and return to Vakkengard. In fact they used the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md) and send him his daughter’s head as a warning. With this knowledge the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) infiltrated the church of the twelve (Where the Tribune was staying) in the middle of the night and ambushed his Tribune and his bodyguards, successfully defeating them and killing them in the process. The rest of the legion did not have the will to fight back and they turned tail and ran from Vakkengard.
