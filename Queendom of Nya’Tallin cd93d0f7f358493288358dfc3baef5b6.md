### Summary

The Queendom of Nya’Tallin sits on the southern side of Valkoria, it’s the warmest country in the continent and one where most of the natural resources have been heavily exploited. Around the year 3180, the Queendom started running lower on resources and the Noble houses were tightening their grip on the people.

The Twelve are an important symbol for the queendom and the people are highly religious and super stiticous. 

### The Noble Houses of Nya’Tallin

As a Queendom, Nya’Talling always has a female ruler. The country is split into many small fiefdoms each ruled by a noble house. The houses are known by their name. For example the area around the capital is ruled by House Mavis which is also the royal family. These noble houses handle their own regions autonomously from each other but most of the legal matters are equalised by the ruling queen.
