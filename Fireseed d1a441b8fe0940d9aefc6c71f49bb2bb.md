# Fireseed

Tags: Plant
Properties: There is a plant called Fireplant that grew originally on the oasis of the Zedrana Desert, but has been brought to pretty much everywhere due to its usefulness. Its seed, called Fireseed, is filled with oil. By striking it against a rough surface, a small flame is lit, burning the oil inside.
