# Grogak

The Grogak have come to these worlds from the far realms but some of them have settled in the Plane of Law and they have thrived. Their structured method and society are unmatched compared to the other humanoid races, and their sense of self is almost aligned with the sense of their colonies.

Some of the Feral Grogak have stayed in the Material Plane and are treated as an invasive species and hunted like animals.
