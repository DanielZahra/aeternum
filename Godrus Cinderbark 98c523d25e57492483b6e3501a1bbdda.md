### Summary

A young Ashen Elf from Vakkengard. He works in the Militia and is a farmer in out of the outlying farms.

He is reliable and very loyal but has a tendency to drink too much when he's stressed

### **Relationships and History**

After being part of the Liberation of Vakkengard and the village joining the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md), he took his job as a Militia more seriously and started training people properly as they could no longer rely on the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) for support.

He later took a good example out of [Radegundh V Duskember](Radegundh%20V%20Duskember%20ac0c23e3ded6497fb008f10fc5232fbc.md) and [Deron V Duskember](Deron%20V%20Duskember%20dd1dd6f65d3a4723aa6de304304aa79c.md) and took the role as Milita Captain in [Vakkengard (Titan’s Rest)](Vakkengard%20(Titan%E2%80%99s%20Rest)%20b8c329549abf41648464107b78a72b2a.md) and by virtue of this he’s formally also part of the [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md).
