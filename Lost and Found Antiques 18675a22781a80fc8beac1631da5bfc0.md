The [Lost and Found Antiques](Lost%20and%20Found%20Antiques%2018675a22781a80fc8beac1631da5bfc0.md) is a shop that sells a lot of random curios, antiques, used wares, and sometimes the odd trinket or magical item. The shop is attached to the [Candlelight Shelter](Candlelight%20Shelter%2018675a22781a80eaafede158d368710c.md) and the vast majority of the profits here go to help run the shelter and take care of the children there.
