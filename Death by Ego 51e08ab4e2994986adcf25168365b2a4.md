Tags: Story

Authored by [Avnon Songheart](Avnon%20Songheart%20c80f62bcf27647ff914c434f9f06b9c8.md). A book about using one's ego to their own detriment.

- A Hero known to be the protector of the realm
    - They were always ready to help others
    - Basking in the glory of their achievements, always making sure to keep their reputation pristine
    - Loved to be challenged to further their fame and adoration
- One day the Hero was saving a family whose cart was stuck half way down a cliff overlooking a village
- All the villagers were spectating the event cheering the Hero as they lunged to the rescue
- The Hero climbed down holding on to some roots sticking out of the cliffside helping the family one by one
- As the last person was leaping over the Hero's shoulders a villager below yelled "What about the cart?"
- Determined with the challenge the Hero used all their might to swing the cart up with one hand
- As the cart swung up the roots gripped by their other hand snapped under the incredible weight and while the cart flew up the Hero rolled down the cliff
- Landing on their feet trying to ignore the broken shoulder and ankle the Hero looked up to see the cart slowly arching back down onto to them
- Anyone else would have scrambled out of the way but not the Hero, all they could think was "What about the cart?"
- BOOM*
- As the dust settled the cart was saved, still pristine just as the Hero's reputation but the same could not be said for the Hero's neck
