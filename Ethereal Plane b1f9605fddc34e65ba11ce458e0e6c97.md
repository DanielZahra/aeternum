# Unlike most creatures, the  native creatures of the @Astral Plane  grow in power in different ways and some of them can dramatically change over their life. However if they do indeed perish in the  their souls will be scattered into the Ethereal Plane and eventually reborn as mortals in the Prime Material Planes. Once the soul of an  creature is scattered, there is no way for it to be restored or revived unlike the souls for people in the Prime Material Planes.
