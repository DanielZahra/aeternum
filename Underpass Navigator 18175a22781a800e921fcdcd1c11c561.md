# Underpass Navigator

The Underpass navigator is a ‘title’ or job given to those who have learned to navigate the underpass and how to avoid getting lost in the thousands of tunnels in Cerulia’s underground.  Going for long journies without a navigator can often lead to serious problems if parties get lost. Stumbling in an unused underpass filled with monsters is a death sentence.
