Select: Location

Probably the largest tavern and bar in [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) is found right at [St Thaldar’s Plaza](St%20Thaldar%E2%80%99s%20Plaza%2018675a22781a80db8221fb44abf08b1c.md). This Tavern is famous for closing it’s door once their alcohol for the ‘day’ runs out. They close shop and restock, clean up and open again after the owners rest. Being on the 30th level and in the main plaza, this tavern sees a large amount of traffic and also accomodates those that are passing through [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md).
