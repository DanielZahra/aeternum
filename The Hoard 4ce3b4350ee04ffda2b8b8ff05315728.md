# The Hoard

Tags: Universal

A corporation of Merchants that came together and move their goods around the world. Most of them won’t or don’t own shops that stay in one place. Instead they carry their goods from one city to the next peddling their merchandise to the best customers.

A few of the Merchants within the Hoard, will own a magically enhanced Belkemmoth that serves as a mobile home and shop, while also carrying a large number of supplies on it’s back.
