# Covenant of the Pangolin

The people from the Covenant of the Pangolin built an intricate burrow system and lived deep within their Mesa. They had the knowledge, training, and tools to maintain a perfect underground lifestyle. 

Unfortunately, their [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md)s had all passed and the mists enveloped the mesa, adding their covenant to the list of abandoned ones.

Some stories mention that this covenant had some ancestry tracing back to [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md).
