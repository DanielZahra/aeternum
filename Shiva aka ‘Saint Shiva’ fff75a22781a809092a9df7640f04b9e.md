### Summary

Shiva was a powerful Duke who abandoned her post as Duke to travel Aeternum to spread the faith of [Orinda (Goddess of Darkness)](Orinda%20(Goddess%20of%20Darkness)%201ba0ba9957314eefbeaf6ee60c227e13.md). She left [Tenebrium (Plane of Darkness)](Tenebrium%20(Plane%20of%20Darkness)%207718024e47414800b2c2b6077c344e7d.md) after the [Second Planar Divine War](Second%20Planar%20Divine%20War%20b44de7b760df493a8ae035e660537160.md), to share loudly a message that Darkness and [Fiend](Fiend%205049cfc5296c4178bea52b4bbcb5a689.md)s are not all evil or bad. Just like the people the in the [Prime Material Planes](Prime%20Material%20Planes%2020a880ed277044b892497e01fd27933b.md), they can be what they want.

She was also a champion of the [Fiendspawn](Fiendspawn%205223a6b6b6b94d348478ed8a35569169.md) and defened them against discrimination they recievd almost evverywhere. She often avoided the topic of the [Celestial](Celestial%20efe1f151703d415396ce9ab2939af69f.md)s as the Planar Divine war was too fresh.

She spent a lot of time in [Valkoria](Valkoria%2063188c93864440e591a3528e50868ec6.md) which was a country less than 3 centuries old at the time. Every twilight, she held a sermon in [Orinda (Goddess of Darkness)](Orinda%20(Goddess%20of%20Darkness)%201ba0ba9957314eefbeaf6ee60c227e13.md)’s name and eventually gained popularity with the people, even more so after the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) approved her teachings. 

### **History**

Unfortunately in the year 2640 near [Witch’s End](Witch%E2%80%99s%20End%2068ed9e9cc8924625ae221afa3ecc3747.md), where Shiva often held sermons, a group of [Luminals](Luminals%20d98e92c2515d4a87b85262f572b43fb0.md) extremists, assaulted one of her sermons murdering almost all of the people there and crucifying Shiva to end her life. It is said that Shiva while being powerful, did not fight back against the [Luminals](Luminals%20d98e92c2515d4a87b85262f572b43fb0.md) to prove their ways wrong.

By the year 2680, the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) built a Cathedral in [Witch’s End](Witch%E2%80%99s%20End%2068ed9e9cc8924625ae221afa3ecc3747.md) and declared Shiva a Saint of the Twelve, dedicating the Cathedral to her.
