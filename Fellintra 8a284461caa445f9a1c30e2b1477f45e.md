Plane: Prime Material Plane

Fellintra is the wild forest world where nature rules supreme and any attempt to quell the natural growth is met with resistance and dangers. Yet, people persevere, make peace, and live within this world's lush jungles and forests.

Fellintra has a wondrous geography, itâ€™s a massive singular landmass with rivers and lakes in abundance. The planet has no sea (only freshwater). For inexplicable reasons, the rivers around the entire planet seems to flow in a singular direction allowing the waters to never get stagnant. Most believe that the planet itself is alive and moves the water around the surface to maintain its forests and jungles. 

The vast majority of civilization settles around sources of water and not in the dense greens.

### Travel

While travel by boat or ship is possible within Fellintra, it is extremely volatile and dangerous and the bottoms of the rivers and lakes is filled with giant roots and shallows that often block access to ships, not to mention dangerous creatures.

The majority of travel happens by foot with the help of export guides and travellers.
