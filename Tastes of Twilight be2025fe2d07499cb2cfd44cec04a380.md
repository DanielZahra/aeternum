# Tastes of Twilight

Tags: Knowledge

This is a cookbook with lots of strange techniques to prepare exotic food that is meant to be consumed a night time.

This book goes into extreme detail about how to prepare meats, fruits, and drinks to be consumed at night. It explains the theory that food at night tastes better and it should be prepared in special ways.

The main content of the book is about raw meat from many different creatures. This would be considered creepy at best by most people, but fine connoisseurs of food might appreciate some of its topics and methods.
