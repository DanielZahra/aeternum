# Mist Reavers

Tags: Fellintra, Mistvale

Within [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md), the Mist Reavers can be found lurking in the mists and shadows. The Reavers are a group of brigands or pirates that roam in groups in the mists and steal, murder, pillage, and take what they want. 

They abuse the mists and also abuse it by creating highly addictive drugs that make them more dangerous within the mist itself. 

Most reavers live a short and dangerous life, but they have been a greater mence for the more peaceful people of [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md).

A good number of strangers that visit Mistvale and contract the [Mist Plague](https://www.notion.so/Mist-Plague-12675a22781a808fa847f212f7cba311?pvs=21) end up joining the Reavers to stay alive and not succumb to the curse.

### The Plague

While the Reavers boast that they have a cure, the reality is quite different, a large number of Reavers run feral within the mist and attack anything that moves, especially each other.

The Reavers that are still in control form gangs to survive.
