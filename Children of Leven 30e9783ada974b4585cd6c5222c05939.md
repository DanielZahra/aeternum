# Children of Leven

Tags: Ark of Leven

Leven the founder was a Dwarf that started this group of people that lives their life on ships Their main income comes from seafaring and transporting goods or people.

They buy and maintain the best ships and remain neutral between all countries making them richer in times of war.

They Live on the Ark of Leven, a flotilla of shops that can move from one country to the other.

When meeting a member of the ARK, the more tattoos, they have usually it means the more accomplished they are. When returning to the ARK after a long journey, they retell their story to their peers and they get tattoos to remember those journeys.

### Family

The Children of Level, don’t have the concept of marriage of a typical ‘family’. In fact, they consider every single ‘Child’ of Level a part of their family. The parent, be it a mother or father is the one they call the Grand Admiral, who inherits Leven’s Will.

### Gift of the Sea

Sometimes, the Children of Level don’t get paid in gold or merchandise. They get paid with children. Many people see this a barbaric and cruel but the children of eleven need a way to bolster their numbers and raising children on the sea is not an easy life. 

When a customer doesn’t have enough money to pay them, they can promise the Children of Leven their next-born child or any child younger than 6 years old and offer them as payment.

### Ranks within the Children

While the Children treat each other like family, they are stilled organised in a hierarchy or chain of command. At the top rests the Grand Admiral who comments the [Ark of Leven](Ark%20of%20Leven%20fe59ba89f7544b90ba139ded1b5b992e.md) and the [Children of Leven](Children%20of%20Leven%2030e9783ada974b4585cd6c5222c05939.md). Then there are the Admirals who handle the different sections of the Ark and Navy. Under those, you have the captains who each command their own ships and conduct business. The rest of the Children are called brother or sister.
