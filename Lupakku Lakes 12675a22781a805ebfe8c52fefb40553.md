# Lupakku Lakes

The Lake is a large body of water that is the main source of life for everything on the [Mzâ€™Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md) Mesa. The [Covenant of the Wolf](Covenant%20of%20the%20Wolf%2012575a22781a80d99e01f30949cd5c3f.md) make it their own responsibility that this lake is pristine and provides clean water to drink for the Grove. The lake is close enough to the grove and is a safe enough walk for even the youngest of the people. 

Often everyone refers to the Eastern lake as Lupakku lake but there are also 2 minor lakes to the west of the Mesa, which are just called the western lakes.
