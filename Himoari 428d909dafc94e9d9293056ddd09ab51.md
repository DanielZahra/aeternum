Himoari is the home of the, [Hangetsu Clan](Hangetsu%20Clan%204f4cf2951eef4ce1ae0eb026c3b3ab4e.md) (Half-Moon) Clan has been around for a long long time. Their land on the north-western side of [Yamagato](Yamagato%2046d0fc8d09494cf095ac9d96213767c8.md) is extremely mountainous and difficult to attack. 

Himoari was a site of large battles during the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md) and some remanents have remains. Due to the vicinity of the [Raijin Mountains](Raijin%20Mountains%208fd3daf8cbcf450b89542e4ac65b38f2.md), the air is quite cold and there are a lot of narrow paths between the mountains.

A large section of the [Himoari](Himoari%20428d909dafc94e9d9293056ddd09ab51.md) region, is called the **Red Mire Swamp.** It is an eerie, mist-laden swamp, a hauntingly crimson hue envelops the twisted flora. While, the swamp itself gives the shivers, it is a treasure trove of food and materials that has helped the [Hangetsu Clan](Hangetsu%20Clan%204f4cf2951eef4ce1ae0eb026c3b3ab4e.md) has tremendously over the years. Unfortunately, a fiendish hag had made this her home for many years, but the the later part of 3213 the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) managed to defeat her in her own lair, and earning a bounty from the [Hangetsu Clan](Hangetsu%20Clan%204f4cf2951eef4ce1ae0eb026c3b3ab4e.md).

At the far reaches of [Himoari](Himoari%20428d909dafc94e9d9293056ddd09ab51.md), lies an abandoned and unnamed [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md) settlement. The [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) discovered [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) ruins hidden deep down within the [Raijin Mountains](Raijin%20Mountains%208fd3daf8cbcf450b89542e4ac65b38f2.md), and eventually discovered that this was the place the The Vermillion Emperor, Adam was interred for millennia and stuck without escape before the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) massacred the [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md) community and Adam himself within the ruins. The ruins were infested with the [Forgotten](Forgotten%2006e3b3ba9eb349538fd9eec617dc7e58.md) born of the warriors of the church and the Titanborn defenders.
