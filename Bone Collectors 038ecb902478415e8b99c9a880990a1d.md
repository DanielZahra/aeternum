# Bone Collectors

Tags: Universal

The Bone Collectors are an elite guild specialized in dealing with dangerous missions or dealing with dangerous monsters. They are quite expensive to hire but brutal in the execution. They will not stop hunting their marks until they are successful even if it means the lives of their members. 

Originally, they started their guild in Cerulia but now they operate in most of the material plane.
