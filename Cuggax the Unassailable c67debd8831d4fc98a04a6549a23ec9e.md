### Summary

Cuggax was one of the brains behind the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md) . When the armies of the Farplanes were defeated on the material planes not all of the invaders were killed or sent back. Cuggax reformed the remaining army on an asteroid with his lieutenants.  Over a few centuries, his Asteroid [Lapis De Fortuna](Lapis%20De%20Fortuna%202274dd93dabc4a7ca72a6ea78996e002.md) became a prison of the unfortunate souls his lackeys kidnapped or coerced into servitude.

Not a single soul ever meets Cuggax as he leads the Psionics with all the secrecy possible. 

His sanctum is hidden somewhere deep in the prison itself.

Cuggax’s goals are the same as the [Blood Coin Creed](Blood%20Coin%20Creed%20a1e3f2b651b049cd88877892c939b8b1.md), gather power to eventually escape or conquer the worlds.

### Skills, Abilities and Possessions

Evil and Cunning with a scary amount of psionic powers make Cuggax a scary 'brain'. None alive has ever seen Cuggax in battle so his abilities are unknown.

### **Relationships and History**

Between 2630-2640 NA Cuggax survived the 10-year Psionic war and a few years after the defeat, he went to start creating the prison asteroid.

He is the secret and actual leader of the [Blood Coin Creed](Blood%20Coin%20Creed%20a1e3f2b651b049cd88877892c939b8b1.md).
