### **Relationships and History**

He befriended the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) he they in turn entrusted him with a secret that lay beneath [Ordona](Ordona%2097fdf7ca0d2f4b10aa4b2958a480b0b7.md).

Later during the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md), Thori was approached by [Avnon Songheart](Avnon%20Songheart%20c80f62bcf27647ff914c434f9f06b9c8.md) with a proposition ,to abandon the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) and push [Ordona](Ordona%2097fdf7ca0d2f4b10aa4b2958a480b0b7.md) to be a part of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md). As much as Thori treated Avnon like family, and wanted to like this idea, he considered this an unsafe and unjust betrayal of the empire, he did however help the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) approach Legatus [Augusta Fenice](Augusta%20Fenice%20401718edc6f140c29c122012657b0422.md), from a secret passage.
