### Summary

She works with the Quills of Ios. She was born in the Plane of Chaos but found herself, in the prime and working with the Quills. She is much older than she looks.

Not much is known about Mildred’s past. She is a strange [Fairy](Fairy%20b1efd6fec06c4ea49830b03850611a97.md). Clearly she knows a lot more than she lets on, especially since she’s an Arcanist within the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) which is quite a high-ranking position.

### Appearance and Personality

Smary and usually in a happy mood. Not much of a fighter but she can help when necessary relying more on speed and magic than strength. She has some quirks and can channel Ios power to read minds.
