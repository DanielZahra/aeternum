It's a large network of contract black market, assassins, thieves and mercenaries that will do work that other people don't do. Most members follow a loose chain of command but precious few actually know what's going on.

### Lost Lore

'Under the hood', there is a giant organization led by a Powerful Psionic that has an Asteroid Prison within the [Pandemonium (Plane of Chaos)](Pandemonium%20(Plane%20of%20Chaos)%20375249c38c0c4dc39d6cd24993a3eb35.md) where they kidnapped able bodies fighters, mages and everything in between and they use them as mercenaries for deadly jobs as disposable meat.

These prisoners are infected by psionic magic where, as soon as they try to betray their mastery, their brains would implode and souls shackled. Not a single soul has ever escaped this organization.
