# Feral Grogak

Tags: Underground

### Summary

When the far plane attack happened, these insectoid monstrosities were controlled and used as footpads and cannon fodder, some of them dug deep underground and remained there surviving for centuries and growing colonies.

- Savage society, based around a queen
- Most of the species can fight, some are soldiers or stronger
- Dangers to their queen will make them throw their lives away to defend her. Should in an event, the queen get lost, most Grogak will go into a frenzy and attack anything in sight as the queen is the regulator of thought in the hive.
- A Queen or Princess can lead a hive even when she is still in her egg and unborn, it's telepathic powers are measured behind what the other Grogak can reach. Because their society is so defensive of the queen, it has been very troubling to study this power.
- They don’t really speak a language but when close to their hive their can communicate telepathically through antennas

### Abilities

- Insectoid (6 limbs) like creatures

- The same skin makes them also suffer from high temperatures and have fire magic weakness.
- The low drones/workers are not very intelligent
- The Soldiers/knights and ‘Priest’ class are leaders and smart

### Homes & Diet

- They are omnivores that meld all their food into gelatinous sugary paste.
- Horde supplies and food in their homes. They then transform their foods into orange surgary paste which is used to grow and feed the colony.
- They create their nested colonies in soft group and network the tunnels together the workers can build a mucus like liquid that solidifies after some time, it's works like hard mud, this allowed them for form their colonies and block some areas.
