# When the snow is soft the weather is permitting, those that live next to mountains go out for a day or two of Snow-planking.  Slabs of woods are filed down and treated to be flexible but strong, at least enough to hold to weight of a person. The people take a small trek up a hill and then unleash their planks and they slide down the hill avoided all mortal danger. It's a sport that's not for the faint of heart.
