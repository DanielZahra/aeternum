[Emberkeep](Emberkeep%2018675a22781a80aa9ef0c954e19a6caf.md) is the headquarters of the [Emberguard](Emberguard%2018275a22781a806cb27adda3a65bbad1.md) found  between the [Skyforge](Skyforge%2018675a22781a8045ba28c6b7ac145041.md) and [Ember Crossing](Ember%20Crossing%2018675a22781a80ac8883dad512cc1278.md).  Emberkeep is an entire layer or section within [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) and by foot it is almost impossible to move between the Crossing and Skyforge.
