[J**udicium (**Plane of Law)](Judicium%20(Plane%20of%20Law)%2046f3842e3c1c42628e25965fffd97b07.md) is the home of the [Arbiter](Arbiter%2065590b0d50694f6b91925a2bc1156e2b.md) and the [Forgeborn](Forgeborn%20bc063bad27a6430d94a7bda0638c9f4b.md). It is not clear not known to anyone how the [Arbiter](Arbiter%2065590b0d50694f6b91925a2bc1156e2b.md)s handle their leadership, but according to studies and great risks taken by historians, it would seem that the [Arbiter](Arbiter%2065590b0d50694f6b91925a2bc1156e2b.md)s have a sort of **Gestalt Intelligence** artifact or machination that allows them to always make the most balanced and logical decisions without having to argue to discuss things. This of course is a major speculation and most people’s minds cannot even comprehend what that even means.

[J**udicium (**Plane of Law)](Judicium%20(Plane%20of%20Law)%2046f3842e3c1c42628e25965fffd97b07.md) is an unnatural landscape that is fully manufactured by the hands and magic of the [Arbiter](Arbiter%2065590b0d50694f6b91925a2bc1156e2b.md)s. The entire plane is surrounded by the electromagnetic force field, that blocks all ethereal, spirit, teleportation, and psionic moves from moving through.
