### Summary

A tough woman who runs one of the seediest taverns in Bellmark's Landing.

She has a deep secret, without much of an option she is helping the Blood Coins run an operation from under her tavern. 

The mind-altering magics of the [Blood Coin Creed](Blood%20Coin%20Creed%20a1e3f2b651b049cd88877892c939b8b1.md) scared her and she dared not challenge them.
