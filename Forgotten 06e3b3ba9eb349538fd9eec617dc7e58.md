### Summary

The forgotten are brainless undead whose bodies have been abandoned for too long. If their souls are not sent over to the other side after they're defeated, they will come back within 24 hours.
When corpses en-mass are abandoned and left to rot without a proper sending, they are ripe to be possessed by spirits of undeath. These spirits react to the broken souls without a sending and once they own the body they will attack anything that lives to reap more souls.
The bodies of the forgotten are rotting and decomposing but somehow hold together. They are nothing more than mindless creature but their broken memories retain their combat abilities. When a group of forgotten get together them seem to follow the strongest one which can easily make them deadly and dangerous.

They are mostly brainless and don't communicate or speak, with the living however they seem to congregate together in their hunt for the living.
