Creature Family: Large Birds

Often confused with Rocs, these Aeriegon are just as dangerous and around the same size, many stories and legends are written about them as they soar the skies of Aeternum.

Originally from [Fellintra](Fellintra%208a284461caa445f9a1c30e2b1477f45e.md), these massive birds are the ultimate bird of prey in the skies of the green planet. 

lots of lives were lost to try and tame or control these creatures. Eventually, a method was discovered, where the eggs are taken from an Adult [Aeriegon](Aeriegon%2089102faba0554af4b11d3562118f6da8.md) and the young ones are grown by people and trained to be ‘less’ aggressive. Through mind control and blood magic, people can actually control these creatures and use them for long journeys in flight. The people trained to use these abilities are experts and it takes many years of training to even try this. 

The Aeriegons are strong enough to fly while carrying a light wooden cabin fastened on their back which carries people inside. This is still hazardous and expensive but is the fastest method of non-teleportation transport known.
