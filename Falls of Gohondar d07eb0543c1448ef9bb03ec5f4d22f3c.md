### Summary

Gohondar is the founder of this  [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md) tribe, all live in relative peace and play their trades. They welcome people into the bottom of the falls but they're still pretty private and don't mix with the other species.

This ‘village’ is built into the mountainside in the shape of Gohondar their founder. These [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md), do not follow [The Twelve (Gods)](The%20Twelve%20(Gods)%207e8a666a7f414fde89581346a9da8da2.md) and there are no chapels or churches to be found in their town. The Falls’s Statue is extremely private and only [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md) are usually permitted inside.

The people of the [Falls of Gohondar](Falls%20of%20Gohondar%20d07eb0543c1448ef9bb03ec5f4d22f3c.md) are mostly Vvgetarians as they live off the land. They have some proper spicy food too.

### History and Events

The [End of the Sixth Valkorian War](End%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%20baaa265f20174631be11e4821e2552ba.md) made the [Falls of Gohondar](Falls%20of%20Gohondar%20d07eb0543c1448ef9bb03ec5f4d22f3c.md) the center of it all. Within the large statue and the Feet, the armies of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md) and [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md) clashes against the forces of the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md). Meanwhile an elite force infiltrated the statue to eliminate the mastermind [Draco Palantine](Draco%20Palantine%20a13f23282dc5412f903101a7e1104612.md). Following [Draco Palantine](Draco%20Palantine%20a13f23282dc5412f903101a7e1104612.md)’s death, the Empire’s army quickly retreated. While the war was won, [Falls of Gohondar](Falls%20of%20Gohondar%20d07eb0543c1448ef9bb03ec5f4d22f3c.md) was left leaderless and in shambles. 

[Marga Stoneshaper](Marga%20Stoneshaper%20f2626b46e59e4be78f617b23734ea3f8.md) the daughter of the Kenos Stoneshaper, the previous chief, managed to bring her people together and act as a representative for the [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md) within the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md). Following this [Falls of Gohondar](Falls%20of%20Gohondar%20d07eb0543c1448ef9bb03ec5f4d22f3c.md) officially joined the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md) and control the western side of the inner Valkorian sea.

### Points of Interest

Nestled within the [Western Valkorian Mountains](Western%20Valkorian%20Mountains%20316724fac01f45dca3fd6037705cdf38.md) are a large group of ruins of the elden [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md) who studied the stars and lived on the tallest of mountains. Nobody is sure how they met their end or perhaps they migrated down the mountains and now have settled in the [Falls of Gohondar](Falls%20of%20Gohondar%20d07eb0543c1448ef9bb03ec5f4d22f3c.md).
