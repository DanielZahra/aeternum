# Jotun

Originally from the frigid White Wastes of Kas'velar, the muscular and large humanoids have thick skin that takes keeps them warm in the arctic cold. They are mostly nomadic by necessity and tend to keep to themselves. They are believed to share an ancestry with the Titanborn but no written history had ever mentioned or approved this.

They are sometimes also called Half-Giant as an ‘insult’ of not being a full-sized Titanborn. This comment has gotten a lot of people hurt, maimed or killed.

Some of their numbers do cross the mountains and join the barbaric tribes of Kas'Velar and some even venture to the other places in the worlds. Their towering physique often gets them into bodyguard jobs or fighting pits.
