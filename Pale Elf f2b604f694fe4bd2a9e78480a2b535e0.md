# Pale Elf

### History

Also known as Astral/Far Elves, as they came from the Astral Plane abord the Psionic ships. These people are not native to this world, when the Psionic Wars started, many of them were used as combat slaves and sent to fight for the Aberrations. After 10 years of struggle many of them die but many, also changed sides and helped fight off their slavers. Small pocket communities of them formed on the material plane and they made these worlds their new home.

Some of them dream of going back to their original homes, but the vast majority have given up as they were born and raised in Aeternum.

The most people these elves don't look very different from the other elves but to the educated eye, they can tell they're the outsiders elves. Some have come to also call them the Pale-Elves due to their pale skin.

### Astralia or the Azure Star

The thought to be Homeworld of the Pale Elves, they’re not even sure if that was the real name anymore as the Pale Elves’ history is lost to them. 

### Astromancy

Astromancy has always been associated with the Pale Elves' way of life since time immemorial .It is speculated that the Pale Elves on Astralia already had a deep connection with the stars, in particular with the three primary constellations of the Archer, the Chalice and the Dragon. This is backed up by the existence of ancient tablets depicting these constellations that have been passed on for generations, now preserved in the Bibliotheca in Stellaria.

### Ancestry

It is speculated that while the Pale Elves were enslaved on spaceships, they found solace in the stars that they had always known since any deity they may have had back in Astralia was long gone or had abandoned them. The Archer, the Chalice and the Dragon remained there in the sky, ever watchful, guiding and protecting the Pale Elves in their darkest times.

Perhaps this is when astromancy itself originated, possibly due to the fact that the Pale Elves began to worship these constellations, and their faith and conviction empowered the magic that they derived from the stars. Whether this is true or not, the practice of astromancy eventually evolved to become much more scientific, with star patterns and mathematical equations being the primary means from which the magic of the stars is now harnessed.

Due to the importance of the stars for the Pale Elves, and the fact that most of their history has been forgotten or erased in their imprisonment, the Pale Elves put a lot of value in the passing on of knowledge. For this reason, Pale Elves began the practice of giving a star map (originally in tablet form but eventually in parchment) to their newborn children, which are preserved and treasured as a symbol of their people. These star maps hold even more importance to the astromancers, who utilise such maps in their magic.

Any Pale Elf typically carries their star map with them at every time. Astromancers typically place their star map in a decorated scroll case tied to their side in the same way one would hold a weapon's sheathe. This not only represents their connection to the Pale Elves but also the idea that the stars are their weapon of choice over other mundane weapons.
Some of the Pale Elves have now fully adopted life in Aeternum and follow the [The Twelve (Gods)](The%20Twelve%20(Gods)%207e8a666a7f414fde89581346a9da8da2.md) and not show much interest in Astromancy or Astrology.
