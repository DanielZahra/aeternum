### Summary

The Prince of Nya'Tallin is not that 'useful' as his title does not bring any power, especially since his sister is in-line for the throne. He lived his life in that shadow but he's made the best of it. He's a free spirit who wants to see the world and travel around.

Eventually, he would have to go back and act as the General for his sister's armies.

During his travels with the [Radical Dreamers](Radical%20Dreamers%20b4fc63729c9643128f5ce4696750a215.md), he learnt that his father was imprisoned in the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) ‘s capital and together with the [Radical Dreamers](Radical%20Dreamers%20b4fc63729c9643128f5ce4696750a215.md) he managed to get him out and try to escape back to the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md).

Sightseeing, travelling and experiencing all that he can so that he can go back and tell his stories to his younger sister.

While travelling he does not want people to know his identity. He's going around with his bodyguard [Jamari Grey](Jamari%20Grey%20ce122cc000794f4c9a76a7517e840435.md) , but he's just getting started.

Eventually, his goal to save his father turned into an obsession which soured the prince and made him hateful towards the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) and its people.

### **Relationships and History**

He followed the [Radical Dreamers](Radical%20Dreamers%20b4fc63729c9643128f5ce4696750a215.md) through the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) and eventually managed a daring rescue of [Ternian Mavis](Ternian%20Mavis%204a5f61b8de9746faa5162371628ef061.md). As they stayed hidden and disguised, and a few months later they ([Cameron Mavis](Cameron%20Mavis%205658a635029e430cb235619939f851eb.md), [Jamari Grey](Jamari%20Grey%20ce122cc000794f4c9a76a7517e840435.md) and [Ternian Mavis](Ternian%20Mavis%204a5f61b8de9746faa5162371628ef061.md)) tried to make their escape while the [Radical Dreamers](Radical%20Dreamers%20b4fc63729c9643128f5ce4696750a215.md), covered for them.

However the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) was onto them and intercepted their movements in the mountains with the involvement of the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md) and the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md).

The Prince eventually was brought back to [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) and publically executed to humiliate the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md) and it’s Queen.
