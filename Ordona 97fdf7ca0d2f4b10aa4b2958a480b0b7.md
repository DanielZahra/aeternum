### Summary

Ordona is a quiet and humble town in the centre of the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) . A good number of the people working here, spend a lot of time working in the quarries north of the town. The quarries are rich with good sandstone that moved across the empire and are mostly used for building. Of course, rare stones or gems can also be found too. On a hill sitting about a mile off the town, lies a very old and abandoned fort from before the continent was united by [Valkorian Sunstriker](Valkorian%20Sunstriker%20022238d5c0024e84a1aa88a05af19c06.md) .  It is said that the fort itself was one of the first places Valkorian obtained after he became a famous adventurer, this of course happened way before he went on to unite the continent.

The people of [Ordona](Ordona%2097fdf7ca0d2f4b10aa4b2958a480b0b7.md) are very casual and friendly, because of the small size of the town, they don't even need a Preator of the empire, they report directly to their mayor, [Thori Stoneshaper](Thori%20Stoneshaper%20f602d71f254146fbbead81630861cc9d.md) who in turn reports to the Praetor of the nearest Empire City.

Walking around this town is an amazing experience. A good number of sculptors must live here as the entire town is surrounded by amazing statues and stonework of many different kinds. The architecture used for building the houses is also articulate and solid.

The farmland around Ordona has a large number of black olive trees that surround the town from all angles. These olives are part of the local cuisine and making with Ordona's Famous Olive Oil.

Following the [End of the Sixth Valkorian War](End%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%20baaa265f20174631be11e4821e2552ba.md), Ordona, became an even more important place within the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) as [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) was now independent, Ordona was the main link between the heart of the Empire and their eastern reach. This saw [Ordona](Ordona%2097fdf7ca0d2f4b10aa4b2958a480b0b7.md) grow from a village to a town in a matter of months.
