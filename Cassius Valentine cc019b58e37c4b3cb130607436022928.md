### Summary

A strange individual that arrived to Aeternum from another Universe altogether. When he landed in Runaria he found that his previous magic and powers did not function as they did in his world in his world. 

None know how long he has been in [Runaria](Runaria%2013a9b9a7f3ee4868a3a851155c4ea24b.md) or Aeternum, stories about the Pale Prince are sparse and mostly treated as myths.

### **Relationships and History**

Cassius is the creature that brought with him the curse of Vampirism/Nosferatu to Aeternum.

### Lost Lore

Before moving to Aeternum he absorbed the full soul of an [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) within himself.

It took many centuries to tame and harness the power of that soul and Cassius Managed to create a Dark Paradise for himself in the eastern reach of [Kas’Velar](Kas%E2%80%99Velar%20476c9e227f2443eca550f0ab8be45af5.md) is now known as the Shadowlands.

By Aeternum standards Cassius is an Abomination that achieved immortality. None like him ever existed but, legenda from [Kas’Velar](Kas%E2%80%99Velar%20476c9e227f2443eca550f0ab8be45af5.md), call some of his kind the Nosferatu, Vampires or Blood Suckers.
