During the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md) a large numbers of pirates took over the town as the [Queendom of Nyaâ€™Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md) could not overextend their troops to provide support, due to the fighting with the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) throughout the [Western Valkorian Mountains](Western%20Valkorian%20Mountains%20316724fac01f45dca3fd6037705cdf38.md).

[Marcus Steeljaw](Marcus%20Steeljaw%2085d3a81781fd4875b63130eac6d909ad.md) and a good number of [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md) sailed into Verdanport and liberated it kicking the pirates out within less than a day.
