# Merfolk

Playable: NPC Only

The Merfolk are people that live in the seas of [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md). Most of them are adept at living under the water but not to well out of it. 

Most of the Merfolk have evolved differently than the aquatic life around them and developed into communities. (Examples of Merfolk are Mermaids and Tritons)
