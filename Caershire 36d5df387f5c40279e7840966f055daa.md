### Summary

Caershire also known as **'Weavers' Ville’** was built in a bountiful area in the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md). The story has it that a family of spinners lived here and more families moves in the vicinity and grew into a community, complete with wool farms, dye farms, milling and all the devices and people you would need to create a lot of clothes.

William Collins, the town major is responsible for keeping it in shape and also collecting the taxes for the [House Timbercroft](House%20Timbercroft%2044a6784cacfc4f848fb095e8737c423f.md) . The town itself lives in harmony and most people are of the working social class so the clash between nobles and the commoners is not that present here as it is in the capital.

The town itself is also famous because it resides close to the Nya'Tallin's College of Arts, [Duztar’s Step](Duztar%E2%80%99s%20Step%20186ea4cd71c447149950d98abcc3fc92.md) , where nobles and rich people can study the arts and mingle together. Of course, the college itself teaches, arts, drama, music and magic.
