# Quills of Ios

Tags: Universal

A group of scholars, mages and adventurers dedicated to the gathering of knowledge. Their main goal is to gather all the knowledge but they try to not interfere with the political world where possible. They are very secretive and try to stay a secret. The only way to join their ranks is to be recruited by their own members.

Their main goal is to make sure that knowledge is preserved and shared when it makes sense to share it. While the Quills are named after [Ios (God of Knowledge)](Ios%20(God%20of%20Knowledge)%2072288785720b414caad2b17760c9a5f8.md), that does not make them a religious group, however, they do respect the gods, and especially Ios.

### Quills Headquarters

The Quills have a secret library residing in a pocket dimension in the [Ethereal Plane](Ethereal%20Plane%20b1f9605fddc34e65ba11ce458e0e6c97.md) that can be accessed via several well-hidden portals around the planes. Precious few know of this location and it's a well-guarded secret by the highest members of the order. Lower-ranking members would not even know that this place exists.

They do have physical places that are libraries around the worlds but they're nothing in comparison.

The Veils of Ios were the item given to the high-ranking members that were allowed in the secret library. As all the books were enchanted to not be read otherwise. Without such a veil, an intruder that somehow made their way in would still not be able to read anything within (not even the book/script titles).

### Quills Branches

In 3213 [Shi-rai Igarashi](Shi-rai%20Igarashi%202b00fac466024354b0273317d2e43ca0.md), [Flake of Snow](Flake%20of%20Snow%200acbb6e796964907a336f61d1c3903dd.md) and the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md), forged a new home for the Quills in Bellmark’s Landing. This served as their home for over a year. Following the [End of the Sixth Valkorian War](End%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%20baaa265f20174631be11e4821e2552ba.md) and region turmoil. They went on an expedition to [Valkorian’s Seat](Valkorian%E2%80%99s%20Seat%20eb373989a5ab4abcaae4c4f0264b3656.md) and were set to find a new home there with the help of the Lightseeker Family (mainly [Alekos Lightseeker](Alekos%20Lightseeker%20e88632a005164453b65ab549e06ec1ad.md) and [Stefanos Lightseeker](Stefanos%20Lightseeker%20c1f3e3aeb4b64f23b01036e85a984da6.md)) 

### Secret Lore

The Steward of the Quills holds an Artifact known as the [Tome of Ios](Tome%20of%20Ios%20eda1240887e94f3cb8daeba306953319.md), this tome holds the knowledge of all Stewards that came before and when passed on to the next Steward the new Steward of the Quills gains the knowledge of their predecessors. 
The tome has a special quill that allows writing within the pages of the tome itself. No other writing implement can mark the pages of the tome itself. 

The [Tome of Ios](Tome%20of%20Ios%20eda1240887e94f3cb8daeba306953319.md) also is the key to open the door to Quill’s secret library. Unfortunately, once a Steward inherits the [Tome of Ios](Tome%20of%20Ios%20eda1240887e94f3cb8daeba306953319.md) and binds to it, they cannot leave this library by any means.
