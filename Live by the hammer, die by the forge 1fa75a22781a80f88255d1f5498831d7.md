# Live by the hammer, die by the forge.

Tags: Religion, Tradition

The actual book is written by the [Blackfist Clan](Blackfist%20Clan%2017875a22781a80ff8157d9b5f94967af.md), but the tradition itself is much older.

‘Live by the hammer, die by the forge.’ carries a large amount of dwarven story and heritage from the dwarves of Cerulia. Having lived underground for as long as their history has writing, the dwarves here have a special bond with their tools and building methods. 

This book is as much about tradition but also religion venerating [Iknos (God of Law)](Iknos%20(God%20of%20Law)%20ff4278878e3d4fcbb67d442139bee0aa.md) and [Duztar (God of Creation)](Duztar%20(God%20of%20Creation)%20252162e6f71046f5a85edb2a0f0651d3.md) equally.

The phrase ‘Live by the hammer, die by the forge.’ is a common one within the modern dwarves and it’s use has transcended this book. The main subject of the book is how one would live their life toiling, working, building and making sure the tools they use are maintained well, taken care of and eventually passed over to the next kin.

A large number of people, not just Dwarves have also taken this calling and also use this as a funerary rite. When performing the [Rite of Sending](Rite%20of%20Sending%20a2533f1f37fd413fa2e21619fe19329d.md), the body of the the person is also places inside a forge they felt close with or used to craft their tools. The forge is left to burn on a lower temperature as the body, bones and all slowly decompose into dust, which is called Grave Ash. This is a lengthy process and the forge itself is barred from being used during this time. The tools, weapons or Armor owned by the dead person, are left to stand next to the forge and when their body is completely gone, their kin collect their items and are free to use them.
