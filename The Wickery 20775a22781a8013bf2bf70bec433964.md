The Wickery is a ‘Light’ shop but also serves as the base of the Goldenwick Clan. Their role in [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) is to ‘keep the lights’ on. They sell candles and make sure the everlights around the city are lit and maintained.

The Goldenwick clan also has an accord with the [Pilgrims of the Everlight](Pilgrims%20of%20the%20Everlight%201d975a22781a80bfa307f1f6b2f2526f.md) to act as their main supplier in this region.
