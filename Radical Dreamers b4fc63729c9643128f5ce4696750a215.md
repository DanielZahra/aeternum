# Radical Dreamers

Tags: Queendom of Nya'Tallin

Travelling troupe of musicians who move around where they can and provide entertainment to those that want it. They host one main show per week, which earns them enough money to travel around the world and put up more shows.

They have made quite a name for themselves for the unique magical experience. They have quite a system in place, and the skills required to make it happen. Their tickets vary between 10 to 100 gold depending on the place.

They set up a normal tent which looks fancy but it doesn't match what the people are going to experience on the inside.

### The Show

They have a very skilled illusionist who prepares a magical mansion in another dimension which transports all the people into this amazing opera house with food, and seats facing the middle, which is a small stage. Everyone then is asked to drink in their special potion or concoction which is a Dream/Sleep magic potion. This is produced in masse so it's as not as powerful as a direct spell. Everyone is then transported to the [Dreamscape](Dreamscape%20de4c628cea234b0392cd11ef24fa0ba6.md) and raptured by the dream spell as the show starts. All the visitors will feel the ecstasy of this and it's amazing. When the show is over people wake up safely in the mansion and can leave when they're ready.

### Protection

Of course, alongside their troupe, they have many skilled guards. These are necessary as the Radical Dreamers become more famous and they also make a decent amount of money.

### **Lost Lore**

Originating from the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md), this band of musicians and acrobats are also used to spy, observe and sometimes cause issues to other nations. This is mostly lead by the one known as the Impresario, [Fowlin ‘Kellyn’ Goldleaf](Fowlin%20%E2%80%98Kellyn%E2%80%99%20Goldleaf%206ed7070e547343c083c753a11cf373e3.md) who leads the Radical Dreamers.
