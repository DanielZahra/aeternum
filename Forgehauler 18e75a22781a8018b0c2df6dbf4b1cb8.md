Tags: Vehicle

The Forgehauler is currently a protoype and one of a kind vechile or a train like cart which had the some of the brightest minds included in its design. A combinatin of [Zan Glittercase](Zan%20Glittercase%2059c5571931964659808d591dec92d1ce.md), the [Cartwright Mining Company](Cartwright%20Mining%20Company%20f79f9b33748f47138ae14b4630685d49.md) and [Blackfist Clan](Blackfist%20Clan%2017875a22781a80ff8157d9b5f94967af.md), this [Vibranium](Vibranium%20e87e3824a03a40a4bbe7a73b0a809aec.md) powered train, has the capability to ride on the rails but also switch to cart mode and be pulled like a regular wagon. The inside has enough living space for a family of 10 and contains all ameties for forging, crafting, cooking, and resting. While probabaly not the best of rest or homes, it definately beats sleep on the floor or in a tent.

It has been constructed of very durable but lightest material to allow 1 or 2 strong beasts to pull it.
