This has shaped the people of the [Covenant of the Wolf](Covenant%20of%20the%20Wolf%2012575a22781a80d99e01f30949cd5c3f.md) and within [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md) have built their society and home/

## Daily Life

The people of the wolf are very traditional and stick together. One could say that they emulate a Wolf Pack. That is how their Grove is built and run.

### Families

Families with the Covenant are usually on the smaller side, the Grove never grows much more than 400 people. Most families marry within the grove itself and will rarely leave or marry into outside families. Most of the families will also keep multiple wolves as part of the family. These wolves are part of the Covenant as much as any other person.

### The Feasting

When twilight hours hits [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md), everyone gathers around the [Wolven Tree](Wolven%20Tree%2012675a22781a809d9633c36e83806e1a.md) in the center of the grove and has dinner together, this is called the Feasting. Everyone in [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md) is entitled to eat, including outsiders and those that do not provide for the Grove.

### Hunting

Nobody in the Covenant of the Wolf hunts alone, the mists are dangerous enough, and Wolves do not want to become the prey to monsters. During the midweek, the able-bodied hunters adventure into the outer area of the mesa or start head down into the mists to find the game to hunt. When they return with enough food, they talk to the ‘Caller’ who sends out [Animal Messenger](https://www.notion.so/Animal-Messenger-81204a52e09743b39458d41c95887b79?pvs=21) to talk to all hunters and ask them to come back. This helps them not over hunt or waste much of the food. The Caller’s role is an important one as has been something that was learned from the Covenant of the Raven, as most animal messengers are birds.

On the same night when the hunting is done, the Feasting is a bit special, everyone helps with skinning and cooking. The [Covenant of the Wolf](Covenant%20of%20the%20Wolf%2012575a22781a80d99e01f30949cd5c3f.md) celebrate the food with singing, howling, and playing of the kettle drum.
