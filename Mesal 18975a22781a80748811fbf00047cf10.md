# Summary

[Mesal](Mesal%2018975a22781a80748811fbf00047cf10.md) is a medium-sized town in the Northern reaches of the [Wisplight Woods](Wisplight%20Woods%2018975a22781a804d9c97c77861c5bf68.md). The people here have a very tight community and there has been a belief where the people help each other through life and work together to form a community. Superstitions and old tales are common place with Mesal, however the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) has very little, if any influence on Mesalians.

The mesalians live in harmony with the [Wisplight Woods](Wisplight%20Woods%2018975a22781a804d9c97c77861c5bf68.md) and built their homes from the large trees within the wood itself. 

# History

In recent years Mesal has been hit by a plague of undeath and the people here have sought out help from the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) to deal with the problem. The issue itself, is not yet resolved and the Town has suffered a lot due to this. According to the Clerics of the Church, within the Northern Reaches of the [Wisplight Woods](Wisplight%20Woods%2018975a22781a804d9c97c77861c5bf68.md) is an ancient curse of undeath but none have been able to make heads or tails of it and a group of young’uns have set out to find the solution for this terrible curse on their lands. The people here are a hardy bunch and won’t abandon their home just yet.
