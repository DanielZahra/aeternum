# Unliving

The unloving group of species breaks the rules of the soul cycle. Common people sometimes call them undead and treat them the same way as any monster. Undead creatures have existed as long as the soul cycle, but the intelligent Unliving are another matter. Tracing back recorded history would show that they havenâ€™t been around for longer than 2 centuries and the first records on them are around 2950 NA.
