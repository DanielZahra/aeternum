# In rare cases, a person can have a dream that is pulled not from their memory but from a fragment of their soul. They live through an episode of someone else's life.

From the limited knowledge, some Academics also think that this is why plane-touched people are born such as @Lightborn, @Fiendspawn and @Elementian.
