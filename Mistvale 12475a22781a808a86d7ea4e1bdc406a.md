Mistvale is a mammoth-sized cenote, shrouded in mists and full of life and bountiful resources. The Vale has a ground level completely shrouded in the mists and is a thick jungle mixed with rivers and cavers. Across the Vale there are plenty of mesas that pierce the mist, some of which are above the cloud level, making them habitable for people. The population of [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md) is somewhat seclusive, mainly due to the fact that their lands are very hard to access, due to the dangers of the mist and also the geographical position.

## People

The people of Mistvale live in Groves (Hamlets) usually not more than a few hundred people, and more often than not found on the top sides of the mesas, although some people do actually live in the mists. The main Groves each adopt a Covenant usually tied to a [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md).

## History

Within the history of the [Mistvale Covenants](Mistvale%20Covenants%2012475a22781a8065837dce230c5a76cb.md), a story is passed down noting the birth of the [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md) itself and the nature of the mist.

> Once, the grounds of the [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md) were a lush jungle full of live basking the in light and sleeping during the night. The land was rich in natural [Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md), it is not understood what exactly happened but the general consensus is that many outsiders came to try and mine the Aeternite Crystals, which result is fierce competition and outright hostility in the region. This resulted in a catalysmic event which ignited the [Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md) Veins in the land, and caused a titanic shift in the tectonic plates of [Fellintra](Fellintra%208a284461caa445f9a1c30e2b1477f45e.md) under the [Root Highlands](Root%20Highlands%2012475a22781a8058a396f87968caad98.md). This caused the land itself to sink created the massive cenote. The explosion of magic and natural disasters left a broken land, full of mist. As the land itself, the jungle grew back and is the [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md) of the present. The Mist, is said to be a result of the catalysmic event, and anyone versed in Spirit Magic will see that the veil between the [Ethereal Plane](Ethereal%20Plane%20b1f9605fddc34e65ba11ce458e0e6c97.md) and the [Prime Material Planes](Prime%20Material%20Planes%2020a880ed277044b892497e01fd27933b.md) within [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md) is very ‘thin’.

## Climate

[Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md) has a unique environment, the mists are always present but vary in thickness. In the higher altitudes the mists are less thick and merge in with the clouds. Within [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md) the rain is almost a constant, with very little days where there is no rain. This rain is not heavy but keeps a constant flow of water going down from the Mesas which waterfalls down into the valley. The ground of the vale itself is marshy and muddy and very hard to traverse.
