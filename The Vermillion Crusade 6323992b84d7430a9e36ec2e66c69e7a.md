# The Vermillion Crusade

In 1233NA when the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) sailed towards the [Dragon Lands](Dragon%20Lands%20ce9140f993044a80964a1b2ba0eb025a.md) and fought the Vermillion Emperor on open seas, defeated the mighty [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) but losing the entire fleet in the process. It is said the battle happened where the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md) is now found.

Up to this day, the [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) people still donâ€™t closely follow the [The Twelve (Gods)](The%20Twelve%20(Gods)%207e8a666a7f414fde89581346a9da8da2.md) because of this event.
