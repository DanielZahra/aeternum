### Summary

Born in 2622 NA, Drago was the lazy successor who inherited the [Valkorian Vestiges](Valkorian%20Vestiges%202bb89e3c957d4dd5b92d719ecb912a0b.md)  and was made Chancellor. This was only done as all his siblings were killed in the Psionic War.

The debaucherous Drago was not ready for this nor did he have any children or siblings left. Dragged into the war without any training or preparation he was slaughtered on the first day of combat

In 2647 NA the [Valkorian Vestiges](Valkorian%20Vestiges%202bb89e3c957d4dd5b92d719ecb912a0b.md) were divided and taken by the highest-ranking generals at the time, who eventually managed to defend Valkoria from the invasion and win the war a few years later.
