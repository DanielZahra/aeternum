### Summary

Violet was always a bit of a creepy kid. As she grew older her psionic powers grew. Since the psionic wars, it would not be the first time that people were born with strange mind-altering changes or powers.

Sold off as a stable kid and made a run for it, she now survives in the streets of [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md)  trying to make a living and also trying to join the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md) 

She spent most of her time with her friend [Aza Velarin](Aza%20Velarin%20fc71256962bd4cf8ad00032455c34a4d.md) 

### Appearance and Personality

She tends to stay on her own and doesn't like a lot of people. Her mind powers are hard to control.

### **Relationships and History**

She met and worked with the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) on multiple occasions but was never too friendly with them.

Seeing how the Syndicate conducted business she betrayed them and joined the [Copper Rats](Copper%20Rats%2080dc3a7e773e4b7f97ceadc9f93ace8c.md) which earned her a bounty of her head.

During the rebellion of [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md), somebody collected on the bounty as Violet was found dead in the streets with an arrow stuck in the back of her head.
