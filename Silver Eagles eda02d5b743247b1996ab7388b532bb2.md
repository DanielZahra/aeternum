# Silver Eagles

Tags: Universal, Valkorian City-States

Adventurers and Mercenaries International Guild. The Silver Eagles try to take on most jobs and keep them above board. Being a larger guild is difficult, so they divide themselves into chapters. Each chapter functions in different locations of the planes and works on its own jobs as its own unit. The Silver Eagles don't belong to a singular country or continent; they are an interplanar organization. They accept members from all walks of life but vet and test them before they can represent the Eagle's name.

Hiring the Silver Eagles is extremely expensive, but they are worth every penny. Every single member is an elite soldier who can think on their feet and is extremely loyal. They stay away from most illegal or criminal activities and only choose jobs that align with their moral code.

They wear an iconic, single-shoulder cape with a large silver eagle. The higher-ranking members also adorn their weapons and armor with a silver finish.

### Events

The Eagles were contracted to protect Bellmark’s landing in the 6th Valkorian War. A dangerous job that put them in the middle of Valkoria and at the mercy of bigger countries.

After some months [Marcus Steeljaw](Marcus%20Steeljaw%2085d3a81781fd4875b63130eac6d909ad.md) councillor and ex-tribune of [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) officially joined the [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md) and the guild was set up as the official partner and defensive force of a the newly found [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md).

With the biggest contract ever for the [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md) being handled by [Marcus Steeljaw](Marcus%20Steeljaw%2085d3a81781fd4875b63130eac6d909ad.md), the previous leader **Mattheus The Bold**, gave the leadership of the [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md) to [Marcus Steeljaw](Marcus%20Steeljaw%2085d3a81781fd4875b63130eac6d909ad.md) and now his aide [Radegundh V Duskember](Radegundh%20V%20Duskember%20ac0c23e3ded6497fb008f10fc5232fbc.md). Both Rade and Marcus have now started building the Silver Eagles to be the defensive force of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md), for all the people regardless of how small their home or land.

This ended the story of the Silver Eagles as a large guild, but their recruitment methods still are vastly the same and unlike other armies. This goes hand in hand with how the City-States operate as a group of cities, and the acceptance of different people into their midst.
