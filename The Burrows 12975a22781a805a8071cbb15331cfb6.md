# The Burrows

A gift from the Covenant of the Pangolin (Which is now unfortunately gone), the [Covenant of the Wolf](Covenant%20of%20the%20Wolf%2012575a22781a80d99e01f30949cd5c3f.md) has inherited the know-how and methods to create stable burrows within the mesa itself, these allow passages from place to place without traveling outsiders. Members of the [Lupakkuâ€™s Claw](Lupakku%E2%80%99s%20Claw%2012675a22781a80a78ccfc343d56a51de.md) are responsible for maintaining and expanding the Burrows around the mesa. While digging new burrows these miners are using several alchemical compounds and tools, while also finding precious rocks and ore that rests within the mesa itself.
