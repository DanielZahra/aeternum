# Wolf Way

Known as the Wolf Way, this is a long-winded, path that travels around the outer area of the Mesa and allows foot ftraffic to travel from the top of the mesa, to the floor of [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md). The journey is long and tiresome and not always safe. The way itself is not patrolled or particularly well maintained.
