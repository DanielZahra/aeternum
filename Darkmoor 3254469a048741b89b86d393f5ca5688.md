## Summary

[Darkmoor](Darkmoor%203254469a048741b89b86d393f5ca5688.md) rests on the far western edge of [Tenebrium (Plane of Darkness)](Tenebrium%20(Plane%20of%20Darkness)%207718024e47414800b2c2b6077c344e7d.md). The metropolis is placed on a large flat piece of ground deatched from the actual land of [Tenebrium (Plane of Darkness)](Tenebrium%20(Plane%20of%20Darkness)%207718024e47414800b2c2b6077c344e7d.md), hundreds of massive chains hold Darkmoor from being swallowed in the abyss, which earned it the name ‘City of Chains’.

As far as locations in [Tenebrium (Plane of Darkness)](Tenebrium%20(Plane%20of%20Darkness)%207718024e47414800b2c2b6077c344e7d.md) go, [Darkmoor](Darkmoor%203254469a048741b89b86d393f5ca5688.md) is pretty ‘welcoming’ (welcoming in this case means, they are tolerated at best) to people from the Material planes and does a lot of business with them. The main population of [Darkmoor](Darkmoor%203254469a048741b89b86d393f5ca5688.md) are the [Xifajk](Xifajk%2083df4bd3d1e5417bb2117d559546cd1c.md), as the most numerous and the ones that love dealing with outsiders.

The main shock value that people from the material planes get when entering [Darkmoor](Darkmoor%203254469a048741b89b86d393f5ca5688.md) for the first time is its sheer size and amount of people that live within. It’s almost impossible to visit the entire metropolis or know of all its places.

In the year 3214, a shocking twist of fate had the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) (a group of outsiders to Darkmoor, participate on behald of the [Malcoris Family](Malcoris%20Family%2041638d15596c4c69914115100a4d2836.md) and won the Rites of Dominance). This shocked the deep-seated foundations of [Darkmoor](Darkmoor%203254469a048741b89b86d393f5ca5688.md), especially now that [Morgan Malcoris](Morgan%20Malcoris%209cb14b1e76e0411e836ed195220e795c.md) is the New Duke.

### Administraiton

This district is where the ruling families live within their enclosed quarters. Each family owns a large section of this district. The ruling failure also gets the quarters of the Duke so they own more land. The district is split into 6 large masses. With a central area that is ruled and belongs to the current duke. The administration district is built on the highest  point of the city.

### Ring of Coins ‘The Ring’

Is a large section of [Darkmoor](Darkmoor%203254469a048741b89b86d393f5ca5688.md) circling all around the Administration district. This is where the majority of the business and trade happens within the metropolis.

### Moor’s Favelas

There are two major slums within [Darkmoor](Darkmoor%203254469a048741b89b86d393f5ca5688.md), the east and the west. This is where the vast majority of the population dwells and lives.

### Walk of the Abyss

### Duke’s Park

On the Southwest side of the city is a man-built park with imported trees and plants from all over [Tenebrium (Plane of Darkness)](Tenebrium%20(Plane%20of%20Darkness)%207718024e47414800b2c2b6077c344e7d.md). This is both a source of food and alchemical ingredients but also recreational. 

### The Collapse

A large hole in the surface of [Darkmoor](Darkmoor%203254469a048741b89b86d393f5ca5688.md), when the city was almost lost to the abyss, a whole chunk from middle dropped into the abyss alongside anyone unlucky enough to be on it. Since then this has been known as the collapse.

### Chained Pit

# Politics

6 [Xifajk](Xifajk%2083df4bd3d1e5417bb2117d559546cd1c.md) Families are responsible for the rule, and only the Lord of each family is selected as a Duke every few years after the Rites of Dominance.

### Rites of Dominance

Whenever a Pentalord wants a Duke to represent [Darkmoor](Darkmoor%203254469a048741b89b86d393f5ca5688.md) the families commence what is known as the **Rites of Dominance.**

Every 4-6 years, the six ruling families engage in a ritualistic competition known as **Rites of Dominance**. This is a complex and dangerous process that tests each family's cunning, power, and ability to manipulate others. The competition is not just about brute strength or wealth; it requires strategy, alliances, deceit, and occasionally, betrayal.

### Rules of the Trials

The acting Lords will stay within the same location and are not allowed to participate directly in the trials, their families or a person they deem worthy can represent them. Each family picks 5 members to take the trials, and there are no substitutions. 

**The Trials**

1. **The Trial of Influence:**
    - **Objective:** Each family must demonstrate their ability to manipulate the masses and sway public opinion in their favor. This trial takes place over several weeks, with each family trying to outmaneuver the others in gaining the loyalty and support of key figures in the town—merchants, guild leaders, military commanders, etc.
    - **Challenge:** The family with the most influence at the end of this period gains an advantage in the subsequent trials.
2. **The Trial of Contracts:**
    - **Objective:** the families are known for their mastery of contracts and binding agreements. In this trial, each family must negotiate a series of complex infernal contracts with various entities. The contracts are judged on their cunning, the value of the entities bound by them, and how advantageous the terms are for the family.
    - **Challenge:** Breaking a contract or failing to fulfill its terms can result in severe penalties, weakening a family's standing.
3. **The Trial of Power:**
    - **Objective:** A show of might, where each family must demonstrate their martial and magical prowess. This can involve summoning powerful creatures, engaging in duels, or leading their forces in a staged battle against a common enemy. The Lords or heads of the families are not allowed to fight themselves within this contest.
    - **Challenge:** Open combat is discouraged; instead, it’s about demonstrating control over infernal forces and outwitting opponents.
4. **The Trial of Deception:**
    - **Objective:** Each family must uncover or fabricate damning secrets about their rivals and use these secrets to discredit or weaken them. This trial often involves spies, assassination attempts, and sabotage. The family that can cause the most damage to their rivals without being caught gains significant prestige.
    - **Challenge:** If a family’s deception is uncovered, they face public disgrace and loss of status, potentially eliminating them from the competition.
5. **The Trial of Unity:**
    - **Objective:** After weeks of betrayal and competition, the remaining families must come together to solve a complex problem or overcome a great threat to the town. This trial tests the families' ability to cooperate despite the betrayals, highlighting the importance of unity in leadership.
    - **Challenge:** This is the most dangerous trial, as alliances are tenuous, and treachery is expected.

### **The Final Decision: The Pact of Dominion**

After the trials, the winning families (typically the last three standing) gather to negotiate the final Pact of Dominion. This negotiation is crucial as it determines the ruling family. The Pact is a combination of alliances, promises, and oaths sworn in the presence of powerful Fiendish witnesses (usually a Pentalord or a Duke or Duchess from within the same Realm).

- **Vote of Blood:** Each family casts a vote for which of the remaining families they believe should rule. These votes are cast in blood and are binding. However, the families can vote for themselves, or they can vote for another family, expecting a return favor in the future.
- **The Infernal Arbitration:** If the vote is tied or inconclusive, the powerful Fiedish witness, steps in to make the final decision. The witness may base the decision on various factors, such as which family best upholds the town’s values or which has the most promising future. The witness’s decision is final and cannot be challenged.

### Outcome

- The winning family rules the town for term, gaining control over its resources, military, and administration.
- The families that lost the competition are expected to serve the ruling family, but they often spend the next years plotting their revenge, ensuring that the town’s politics remain as dangerous as ever. As surprising as it might sounds, the 6 families don’t treat each others as enemies and will easily stick up for each other if there is outside infulence.
- Some Illegal activity that might be comminited during the Rites of Dominance is expected to the forgiven by the new ruling Duke after they gain the power.
