# Lupakku’s Claw

The Claw is where those that shape the objects crafted within the mesa find their tools, work, and livelihoods. Weapons, Gear, Furniture, Carts, Ropes. Whatever the Covenant needs the Claw makes. 

The Claw is dug into the mesa surface and built as a cave with chimneys. The heat of the forges here is not well suited for treehouses.

Within the backside of the Claw, further beneath the surface and roots, there is a Burrow network for storage used by the people of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md).
