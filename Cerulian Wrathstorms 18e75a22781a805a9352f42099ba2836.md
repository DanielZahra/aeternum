# Cerulian Wrathstorms

On occasions, the power of a storm from the surface can make its way underground; these are called Wrathstorms. These storms create very strong winds, which carry debris and electricity and move up to 60 kilometers an hour. In some cases, a strong Wrathstorm can be deadly and completely demolish a settlement. 

Many Cerulian folk have grown superstitious about Wrathstorms and almost believe them to be some form of curse.
