# The Den

The Den is the [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md)’s home. It’s a spiritual place and scared to the people of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md). While the Den is open for everyone there are multiple areas of the cavern where only the Elder Wardens and [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md)s are allowed. When a new [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) is born, they do not leave [The Den](The%20Den%2012675a22781a80a596c8ecd59225cd95.md) for at least a year, where they are thought and trained by the current [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md). Protecting the Den is the main job of the Elder Wardens.
