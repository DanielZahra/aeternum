# Pilgrim’s Rest

Level: 49
Section: Ember Crossing
Select: Tavern

This large mess and bar organically took it’s name and place as the vast majority of the clientele are Knights or Pilgrims that follow the Twelve. being the closest bar to the [Chapterhouse of the Twelve](Chapterhouse%20of%20the%20Twelve%2020775a22781a8006b22febfb83e1171f.md) surely helps this place retain it’s peace as fights or other trouble rarely find their way here.
