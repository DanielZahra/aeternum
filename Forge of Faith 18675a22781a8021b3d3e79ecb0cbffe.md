Those with the need for prayer and the allowance to traverse the [Skyforge](Skyforge%2018675a22781a8045ba28c6b7ac145041.md) will often have their prayers in the [Forge of Faith](Forge%20of%20Faith%2018675a22781a8021b3d3e79ecb0cbffe.md) which serves as the main Cathedral of the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) within [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md). The forge is within the lower parts of the Skyforge and immediately accessible after passing through [Emberkeep](Emberkeep%2018675a22781a80aa9ef0c954e19a6caf.md). The city itself has many smaller chapels where the priests of the twelve will often visit for several sermons on a daily basis.

Within the Forge of Faithâ€™s building area, one can also find the living quarters and training grounds for all the orders of Knights of the Church.
