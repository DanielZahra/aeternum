# Spinners

Tags: Kas'Velar

The Spinners are a society of people living in various Nomadic groups across Kas'Velar. Each Nomadic group spends their lives roaming from village to village to collect stories, legends, and myths, spread knowledge, help out in the villages.

By spinning together different versions of the same stories, they often come close to the truth. Having travelled for most of their lives, the Spinners have a way to pass through the lands avoiding most battles. They try to find out where battles have taken place and left a mess. They aid the people and also gather stories of the battles.

Being Nomads they can't carry a lot of books with them, not that they can find or afford much of them in Kas'Velar. Any book they get their hands on, they will learn by heart and teach each other the new knowledge they gained. They would sell the books afterwards to afford to live and to help out their fellow travellers.  When groups of Spinners meet there is a good chance that some of them would swap groups. This is done to share the knowledge gained with other groups.
