From the heart of [Fellintra](Fellintra%208a284461caa445f9a1c30e2b1477f45e.md) , a breathtaking world dominated by sprawling jungles and untamed wilderness, the Beastkin emerged as an uncanny race. These remarkable beings possess a unique blend of bestial characteristics, embodying the harmony between the wild and the civilized worlds.

### Ancestry

A very old legend speaks of an ancient alliance between the primal spirits of [Foristra (Goddess of Nature)](Foristra%20(Goddess%20of%20Nature)%20228c4ae2b832446cbf62058bf1fbcb16.md) and a group of people who wanted to survive in Fellintra. Through mystical rituals and communion with the spirits, these people underwent a transformative process, granting them the essence of the beasts that roamed the untamed lands around them. History doesn't record if this was a boon of the gods or a curse.

Generations passed, and the descendants of these mystical people gradually evolved into a distinct species known as the Beastkin. They inherited a myriad of feline, lupine, and other beast-like features, seamlessly blended with their forms. Each Beastkin possesses a unique combination of these characteristics, resulting in a diverse and visually captivating race.

The Beastkin developed a deep reverence for the natural world, considering themselves guardians and stewards of the jungle. They live in tight-knit communities nestled amidst the towering trees, constructing intricate dwellings that seamlessly blend with their surroundings. They have honed their skills in hunting, tracking, and survival, utilizing their physical prowess and magical abilities derived from their ancestral connection to the spirits.

As their civilization flourished, some Beastkin felt a strong urge to explore beyond Fellintra's realm, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to learn from other cultures. Venturing into the wider world, they faced both wonder and adversity, forging alliances, experiencing new technologies, and sharing their own unique heritage. However, their homeland, Fellintra, always holds a sacred place in their hearts, and many Beastkin feels a deep responsibility to protect and preserve their home.

### Modern Times
