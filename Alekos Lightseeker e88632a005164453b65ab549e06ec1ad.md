### Summary

[Astellios Lightseeker](Astellios%20Lightseeker%209df94ac6f30949a69dd6c024e821df50.md) ’ older brother and astromancer in training, though far ahead of Astellios himself. [Stefanos Lightseeker](Stefanos%20Lightseeker%20c1f3e3aeb4b64f23b01036e85a984da6.md) is very fond of Alekos and makes it obvious he prefers him, especially since Alekos does everything he can to appease his father. Astellios is jealous of Alekos’ greater astromantic power and how much his father favors him, but Alekos has always been nice to him and helps him in his astromancer training. He remains neutral on Lycian Unification, though Astellios suspects he favors it but is afraid to say so.

### **Relationships and History**

After being abducted by [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md)’s forces and kept as a prisoner in [Argentcourt](Argentcourt%20b41a9e66f343460486a277b32660228c.md), it was clear that working with [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md) was not an option. At the [End of the Sixth Valkorian War](End%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%20baaa265f20174631be11e4821e2552ba.md), both [Stefanos Lightseeker](Stefanos%20Lightseeker%20c1f3e3aeb4b64f23b01036e85a984da6.md) and [Alekos Lightseeker](Alekos%20Lightseeker%20e88632a005164453b65ab549e06ec1ad.md) moved to [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) with [Calliope Lightseeker](Calliope%20Lightseeker%200d801d6e7a9e48979700aa3b30c2462d.md) and [Astellios Lightseeker](Astellios%20Lightseeker%209df94ac6f30949a69dd6c024e821df50.md). They joined the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) and started working to build a new observatory to spread the teaches of Astrology and Atromancy to the people of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md). Eventually moved to [Dawnsreach](Dawnsreach%20761cae0d1e6a43e2ae73a08f7d6fc2ce.md) to continue their work there and make it their new home.

Having seen with his own eyes, how Astromancy can help people, Alekos dedicated a new branch of the Astromancy school to help those who want to use to to fight, and protect everything they hold dear.
