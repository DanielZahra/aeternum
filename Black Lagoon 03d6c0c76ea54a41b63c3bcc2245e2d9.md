A large chain of Volcanic Islands with Active Volcanoes is located between Valkoria and the Dragon Lands. Centuries, if not millennia of volcanic activity has sedimented these islands sin volcanic rock and ash, and most of the vegetation is blackened but thriving.

Sporadic tribes of [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) people live there, one major group are the [Seers of the Black Lagoon](Seers%20of%20the%20Black%20Lagoon%2041eb5baaa79240569f9d652eb7e18087.md), who live in a walled secluded hamlet. The vast majority of them are Shelled Draconians, who live at the base of the biggest volcano on the island known as the **Vermillion Heart**.

The seers believe that the island chain formed after the Vermillion Emperor has fought the army of the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md), and while he took on most of the fleet on his own, he ultimately succumbed and died within the seas. His warm embrace and fiery power birthed this volcanic island. How much of this is truth or myth will always be a mystery.

### **Black Lagoon Observatory**

One of the few proper buildings in the Black Lagoon is the Observatory manner by the [Seers of the Black Lagoon](Seers%20of%20the%20Black%20Lagoon%2041eb5baaa79240569f9d652eb7e18087.md). This is where they studies the stars and also were in contact with other clans.
