Tags: Story

Authored by [Avnon Songheart](Avnon%20Songheart%20c80f62bcf27647ff914c434f9f06b9c8.md). A story about a worrying queen and the price children pay for the stupidity of their parents.

- There was a great war coming
- In order to protect her son the queen asked the mage to create a safe vault for her and the prince
    - The plans need to be written in a language unknown
    - The location needs to be one no one can find
    - The protection needs to use magic that no one understands
- The mage did just what the queen asked and together with her son, the queen hid while the king fought the war.
- The mage died during the war protecting the king and the knowledge of the secret vault was lost with him.
- The king spent 30 years and a lot of his riches to be able to decipher the plans, find the location and finally remove the magic protecting the vault.
- The king was old and had one decision left to make; does he open the vault? If his son lived, would he be fit to run the kingdom or potentially ruin all he had fought so hard to protect or would he spend the last years of his life living with the question unanswered putting the destiny of his kingdom in more certain hands, a second child he had after the war.
