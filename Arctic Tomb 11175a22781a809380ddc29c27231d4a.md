Known as the Arctic Tomb, 2 frigid expanses of land that rest within the north and soul poles of [Runaria](Runaria%2013a9b9a7f3ee4868a3a851155c4ea24b.md). Most scholars have their guesses as to why these continents are frozen over and single handled keep masisve regions of the world cold all year around, even during the summer season. The guess is usually magic.

Very little exploraiton has been done as the temperatures here are immesurably cold and most peolpe or living creature not built for the weather cannot exist here. The core of the Arctic tomb is a mass of cold that has frozen the area around it. Lands that are hundreds, even thousands of kilometers away from the [Arctic Tomb](Arctic%20Tomb%2011175a22781a809380ddc29c27231d4a.md) are will cold throughout the year with a short break in summer because of their proximity to the Arctic Tomb.
