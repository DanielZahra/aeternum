In the mystic annals of time, there exists a dimension shrouded in enigmatic obscurity—a realm, the mere utterance of which sends shivers down the spine of mortal souls. The Void, an elusive entity, unfurls its shadowy tendrils upon the hapless tapestry of mortal existence. When the vaunted gods, masters of both arcane magic and celestial technology, dared to traverse the delicate boundaries of the cosmic unknown, an unforeseen cataclysm befell their sophisticated civilization.

Through the recklessness of ambition or the fickle whims of fate, the Veil that separated reality from the abyss was torn asunder. The insatiable nothingness of the Void, a voracious maw that consumed the very essence of existence, cascaded forth like an inexorable tide. In the span of mere weeks, the once-vibrant world of the gods found itself ensnared in the clutches of impending demise. A civilization that had hitherto conquered every challenge now faced an adversary that defied all conventional comprehension—a nemesis that was, at its core, nothingness incarnate.

Faced with the unprecedented threat of obliteration, the Gods, in their desperate wisdom, devised a plan borne of both brilliance and desperation. Employing the ancient art of realm tear magic, the venerable Twelve, deities whose power transcends mortal ken, endeavored to confine the insidious Void within the vestiges of their erstwhile world. The Twelve, divine architects of cosmic order, became wardens of the Void, custodians of an ethereal prison forged in the crucible of their own world's demise.

Through a delicate ballet of arcane and divine prowess, the Twelve, in a feat of unparalleled sophistication, severed the tendrils of reality that connected their doomed world to the voracious nothingness. The remnants of their once-pristine realm, suspended in a precarious equilibrium, became a vessel for the imprisoned Void—a purgatory ensconced in the skeletal remnants of a bygone existence.

It is a testament to the enduring vigilance of the Twelve that the Void, though confined, persists in its ceaseless hunger. Millennia have passed since that fateful cataclysm, and the divine custodians have labored tirelessly to craft a new world from the fragments of their forsaken domain. Yet, their quasi-full attention remains tethered to the containment of the cosmic abyss, a duty that eclipses even the creation of their nascent world.

In the shadowy recesses of eternity, the Twelve stand as silent sentinels, ever watchful, as they weave the tapestry of existence anew—a symphony of creation and preservation, all while grappling with the incessant threat that is the Void. Thus unfolds the saga of gods too intelligent for their own salvation, eternally ensnared in a dance with nothingness, orchestrating the delicate balance between creation and annihilation.
