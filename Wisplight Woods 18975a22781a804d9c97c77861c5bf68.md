The [Wisplight Woods](Wisplight%20Woods%2018975a22781a804d9c97c77861c5bf68.md) is a very large area within [Noctra](Noctra%2018975a22781a80e292f9c3e10f83874b.md), that is absorbed in vegetation, large valleys, and cliffs. The ground here is arable soil, and the temperature is on the high side. 

## The Drizzle

The days are split in two, the downpour and he dry hours. Due to the ecological environment, within the Wisplight Woods, there are about 12 hours where almost a constant drizzle of water comes from the top of the cavern. (This can be comparable to rain in other worlds). This is followed by about another 12 hours when the water stops pouring. Those with an inclination and studies of nature have concluded that the large trees within the [Wisplight Woods](Wisplight%20Woods%2018975a22781a804d9c97c77861c5bf68.md) carry the water from the soil and rivers, up through their trunks and slowly move it through their branches which cover the roof of the massive cavern. While traveling through the branches there trees nurish themselves with the materials within the water and soil, and clear water is then released from the branches and released back to the ground. 

These trees also capture the sea water that slowly seeps from the sea of [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md)  as the rockface here is somewhat porous.

## Fauna

The [Wisplight Woods](Wisplight%20Woods%2018975a22781a804d9c97c77861c5bf68.md) got itâ€™s name from the wisp-like creatures that flutter in the air all over the woods and emit faint colorful light. Different wisps emit different lights but most of the colours are cool (Blues, Cyan, Emerald, Fuchsia, Greens, Indigos and Magentas)

These woods theme with life and that brings a lot of predators that hunt the woods themselves.
