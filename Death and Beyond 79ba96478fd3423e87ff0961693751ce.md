# Death and Beyond

Tags: Knowledge

This book explores the soul cycle’s meta-physical presence and how it is viewed by the people of the world. 

The topics in this book touch upon how people see the soul cycle in different ways. It goes into great detail describing the actual path the soul travels during the cycle, at least what is believed to be the path.

When a creature dies, its soul slowly starts fracturing into pieces and moves out of their body. While there are ways to restore the soul and life, it is difficult and it won't stop a creature from natural death.

The fracturing is believed to be done to remove the self from the soul and as the fragmented souls travel through the Ethereal, they slowly merge together with souls originating from the same planes. When enough fragments are merged together they form a whole soul.

The main theory of the cycle is that a newly formed soul originating from the Material Plane will be reborn as a creature within the other planes. The reverse is also the case where planar creatures’ souls end up being reborn as souls within the material planes.

The logic of why this happens is unknown and there are several theories about this. Mainly the topics about the soul being closely connected to the power of memories and the gods don’t want people reincarnating while holding on to their old lives.

This book is penned by a number of people originating from the College of Spirit in [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md). It is clear that the research here was done with magic, and those with the power to commune with the spirits, or read them are the ones closest to understanding the cycle.
