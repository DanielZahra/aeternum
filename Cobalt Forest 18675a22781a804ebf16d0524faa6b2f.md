The Cobalt Forest is a large cavern teeming with life and a large amount of blue crystals. The Flora here is tinged with a blue hue and that is how the area got its name. The forest itself is a rather dangerous place especially for those not accustomed to it.

### Obscure History

Around the 2429 NA a group disgruntled people that disliked [Valkorian Sunstriker](Valkorian%20Sunstriker%20022238d5c0024e84a1aa88a05af19c06.md), left their homes in the old continent of Meridien and moves to [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md). They tried to make a home in the Cobalt Forest. Up to this day, one can see their failure spread across the forest as the remains of ruins of their homes can be seen in multiple areas. Their battle with forest was lost as their new home rejected them.
