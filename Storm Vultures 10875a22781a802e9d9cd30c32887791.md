# Storm Vultures

Tags: Air, Material Planes

### Summary

The name Storm Vultures comes from their main home in [Stormreach](Stormreach%20ef8163d9051b4816983d9b716c7da1ed.md).

Carnivorous avian creatures that attack in groups and usually target smaller prey than themselves.

Where there is one Storm Vulture you will find a flock of them, sometimes in the hundreds. 

Since the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md), some of these creatures have been genetically born with psionic powers that make them much more dangerous than the regular vultures and they have the capability to lead their flocks.
