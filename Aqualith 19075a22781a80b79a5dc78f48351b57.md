In the top or first layer of the [Skyforge](Skyforge%2018675a22781a8045ba28c6b7ac145041.md) lies a magnificent **Aqualith**, this [Aqualith](Aqualith%2019075a22781a80b79a5dc78f48351b57.md) is built right infront of the entrance to the [Skyforge Hold](Skyforge%20Hold%2020775a22781a809fbad1d00fc8a18adb.md). it is a massive fountain that serves as the primary source of water for the entire city of Emberdeep. The fountain is built around a large **Elemental Stone**, a glowing, aquamarine crystal that pulses with magical energy. This stone, bound by ancient dwarven runes, draws its power from water elementals, ensuring a constant and reliable flow of clean water.

Water spills from the top of the Elemental Stone into a wide, circular basin below. From there, it is channelled into a network of smaller aqueducts that branch out like veins, delivering water to every part of the city. The aqueducts are sturdy and practical, carved from stone and reinforced with metal, designed to last for generations.

The fountain itself is made of polished granite, with simple but elegant carvings of waves and fish adorning its surface. Around the base, a few statues of dwarven figures and water elementals stand guard, their presence a reminder of the city’s need to water to sustain life and a remnant of the oceans above.

The Aqualith is a central gathering point for the people here, a place where they come to collect water, share news, and gossip every morning. The air around it is cool and damp, filled with the sound of flowing water and the faint hum of the Elemental Stone’s magic. It’s a practical yet awe-inspiring structure, a testament to the dwarves’ skill and their reliance on the natural world.

The less magnificent side of this process is that, as the water trickles down through the aqueducts, by the time it reaches the lower parts of the city, the water is no longer pristine and clean. 

### The Old Water Way

Before the Aqualith was a thing, Emberdeep used a complex system of sewers and water ways with lots of pipes and workers to run the system. Most of the Water Ways have been converted into liveable spaces some still are left in an abandoned state.
