Creature Family: Apes and Monkeys

### Summary

These ape-like creatures have a heavy set and muscular build. Their legs allow them to leap long distances and move and high speeds, while their toes are long enough to allow the Apexclaw to hang upside down and climb most vertical surfaces with just its legs.

The name was derived from the sword-like claws that the Apexclaw has on its hands and forearms. 

Some stories say that an Apexclaw can tear through armor or flesh with ease.
