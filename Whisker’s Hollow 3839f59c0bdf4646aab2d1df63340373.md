Whisker's Hollow is a charming, idyllic village nestled within a serene valley. Its quaint cottages and timbered buildings are arranged haphazardly along the verdant banks of a creek that meanders through the heart of the village. Willow trees dip gracefully towards the water's edge, their long branches casting shadows on the cobblestone pathways. Flowering vines climb the rustic fences, adding bursts of color to the peaceful surroundings. Smoke gently rises from chimneys, carrying the comforting scent of home-cooked meals through the crisp valley air.
