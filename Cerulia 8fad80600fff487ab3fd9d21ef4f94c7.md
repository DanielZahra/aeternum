### General

Cerulia, the world of water and storms. The population of Cerulia has a great divide, those that live in deep underground caverns and those that live on the ‘surface’ within the Oceans of the blue world. The Caverns sit under the water-covered planet protect from the stormy atmosphere.  There are still a large number of species that live in the waters but usually away from the surface. The planet does have a very small area where the surface is not water (volcanoes), but these planes are filled with storms and dangerous weather.

Cerulia's underground world has not been mapped properly as travelling is slow and often dangerous. The people of Cerulia often don't move very far away from their birthplaces. The caverns and tunnels are massive; more often than not, one cannot see very far away or both sides.

The permanent teleportation circles here are guarded and exploited for money.

## Laws and Soceity

Due to Cerulia's harsh environment, maintaining law outside of settlements is nearly impossible. The people have grown accustomed to respecting the authority of their town or city, where rules are typically created by local leadership. However, in the Underpasses and beyond city borders, it's every person for themselves. This makes travel particularly dangerous without proper security. 

### Food

The flora and fauna of Cerulia are exotic to those unfamiliar with it as a lot of things grow without much light. The peoples still have underground farms and produce all sorts of food and hunt game. Some Gnomish and Dwarven people are learnt to dig 'up' so to speak and make excavations that tunnel through and reach the bottom of the oceans. While dangerous the bounty from such adventures yields a lot of seafood which is a delicacy.

### Water

While the surface of Cerulia is in constant storms and rain, the underground never sees rain however water from the ocean can penetrate through the earth and there are plenty of places with dripping water and dampness that has allowed life in the underground to function.

# Environment

### Rocky Belt

Cerulia was believed to have had something strange happen in its old times, around the planet there is a large belt of massive broken rocks, that orbit around the planet. Academics believe that at some point those rocks were part of the surface but some cataclysmic event shattered the planet's surface and the rocks are now suspended and floating and spinning  around the planet and its gravitational field. A good chunk of the people barely knows these exist as they never visit the surface of Cerulia.

### Regions

Due to its geography, Cerulia does not use the idea of a country or 'kingdom', most of its settlements are independent of each other and managed from within.

### Underpass

A good chunk of Cerulia’s civilized locations are connected with large tunnels called the Underpasses. Some natural, some man-made, these long-winded tunnels allow people to travel. The underpasses are dangerous and often people are lost while travelling within, be it monster or bandit, one should take care before they venture within. A number of the underpasses also have rails for carts which allow for travel for number of goods or easier movement for beasts of burden.

### Light

In large portions of Cerulia, the minerals in the stones can refract light coming from the surface which end up bringing some light to the underground world. The high concentration of light is usually where settlements are built and civilization flourishes.
