# Mistvale Covenants

Tags: Fellintra, Mistvale

The Mistvale Covenants are realtionships present between the people of mist veil and the [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) who provides protection for the people. In turn the covenant is reponsible for also protecting the [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) and their offspring. 

The covenants act as a ‘socio-political’ group within [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md) and they have taken it upon themselves to safe guard each other. While each covenant is fully self managed they each work together to strengthen the vale.

## The Wardens

[Covenant Wardens](Covenant%20Wardens%2012a75a22781a80ed9396e90c0fc9ae91.md)

With Each generation, a select number of teens (4 or 5) are chosen to be the Wardens. They are trained in magic, and martial prowess and given the responsibility at a young age to be the protectors of the [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) that is yet to come. The fresh Wardens are scouted by the current of previous Wardens as a young age. The scouting doesn't follow any particular method and each Warden can have several reasons for choosing a specific person as a new warden.

The New Wardens are matched and trained as a team as they grow up. This allows them to form bonds and when the time comes they can rely on each other in life and death situations.

When this Spirit Guardian takes over its animal form their job begins. Each Covenant, has its own Wardens and they all have different methods, training and ways to handling the protection of the Guardian.

Assuming they survive the journey the Wardens will usually end up being part of the leadership in their Covenants and also responsible for the next generation of Wardens as the cycle continues.
