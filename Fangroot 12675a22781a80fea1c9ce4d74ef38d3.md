# Fangroot

This modest building is a place of work, alchemy, herbalism, and magic. All those versed in the above work here to ensure the safety and healthy living of the grove. Each section of this treehouse has its uses and goals. Itâ€™s placed in its secluded area due to the nature of the experiments and sometimes sicknesses that visit the place.
