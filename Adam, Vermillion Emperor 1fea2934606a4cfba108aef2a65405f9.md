Adam, Vermillion Emperor

### Summary

Adam lived through the rise, and fall of the Aezatan Dynasty. He managed to survive the horrors and close extinction of his people. His singular motive throughout his life has been to save their legacy and try to rebuild a semblance of a home or life for the [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) forged in this new almost alien world.

During  [The Titan War](The%20Titan%20War%204b93790f498a457a9172f0b2adb5afc6.md), when it was clear that Adam and his people has no chance of ending things peacefully, Adam was one of the lucky survivors and forefront leaders to push the preservation program.

The [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) built Aeternite coffins that would lock their life essence and soul and preserve them for thousands of years. They would not really be living but the devices were built to allow a wake-up mechanism.

Unfortunately with dwindling resources, and imminent death, the work was rushed a good number of these experiments did not go well. Adam himself in fact did not get a full revival.

His body was stored under the [Raijin Mountains](Raijin%20Mountains%208fd3daf8cbcf450b89542e4ac65b38f2.md) and a group of [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md) people, which was ironic, found him and treated him like some sort of deity. His body was nonfunctional but he slowly gained power. Before he could take over or fix his own body, the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) invaded the clan of [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md) and destroyed Adam’s body. Of course with the power he had left, none of the people within the ruin survived, this allowed Adam’s soul to persevere.

After some years, Adam’s soul was reborn to a high-ranking [High Draconian](High%20Draconian%2083942692fba74247bf1e53cc21847ffa.md) family. As his memories and soul started to ignite the [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) Adam, slowly started to make a name for himself within the [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) people. He took his time to learn about the current world and started working towards the revival of his people.

Of course, the worlds no longer had the magic available to do what he wanted so he needed a long-term plan, also knowing that eventually the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) would be looking for him.

As he became a hero for the [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) people he eventually did what they thought was impossible. He ushered the corrupted form of a Dragon, but instead of going mad with power, he remained in full control. This is where he earned the title of the Vermillion Emperor, coming from his red fiery scales and unrivaled power. Up to this modern day his name is legendary and the legacy of the Dragon Emperor is still living within the [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) people.

Having made such a big mark on the world, the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) was not far behind and after many battles and hunts, eventually, the fleet of the Twelve cornered [Adam, Vermillion Emperor](Adam,%20Vermillion%20Emperor%201fea2934606a4cfba108aef2a65405f9.md), in his fully powered dragon forms over the seas between [Valkoria](Valkoria%2063188c93864440e591a3528e50868ec6.md) and the [Dragon Lands](Dragon%20Lands%20ce9140f993044a80964a1b2ba0eb025a.md). A massive and deadly battle took place where the vast majority of the fleet was burnt to a crisp, but [Adam, Vermillion Emperor](Adam,%20Vermillion%20Emperor%201fea2934606a4cfba108aef2a65405f9.md) eventually succumbed to the might of the army of the church and his body sank to the bottom of the ocean. Legend has it, that the place where the battle took place, is now the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md) and the volcano appeared shortly after the Vermillion Emperor’s death. This of course is a legend and unlikely to be exactly what happened but there is some truth to it.

The [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) was ready this time, and upon his defeat, Adam’s soul was shattered into thousands of fragments, and he could not be reborn again.

### Vermillion Ritual

Although [Adam, Vermillion Emperor](Adam,%20Vermillion%20Emperor%201fea2934606a4cfba108aef2a65405f9.md) was defeated and his soul shattered by the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md), it would not be his end. He knew this would happen and went to some great lengths to secure his survival.

Decades before his bodily death, he forcefully dislodged a chunk of his soul, and locked it away deep in the [Dreamscape](Dreamscape%20de4c628cea234b0392cd11ef24fa0ba6.md). This of course severely weakened him.

As his soul was shattered and fragments of it were being reborn into the people of the worlds. He was slowly transmitting his power and also learning what they were. These people were taking on aspects of his power as both an [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) but now also a Fiery Dragon form. 4 of these people were [Martell Martin](Martell%20Martin%20b19c473bea6545fc8be9d1dca72a2a73.md), [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md), [Brand](Brand%20607d655e23dd44bd8e867a910c8172cf.md) and [Kodron Blackheart](Kodron%20Blackheart%2060f8eb51761d4b8eb60af0fff8d24e2a.md).

[Adam, Vermillion Emperor](Adam,%20Vermillion%20Emperor%201fea2934606a4cfba108aef2a65405f9.md) had devised a ritual that could reverse and join a soul that was one whole. Unfortunately, the people of his time didn’t have the power, know-how or technology to perform it. However, when a fragment of his soul landed in [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md) a powerful and brilliant archmagus from [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md), the ritual was suddenly possible.

In fact during the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md),  [Martell Martin](Martell%20Martin%20b19c473bea6545fc8be9d1dca72a2a73.md), [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md), [Brand](Brand%20607d655e23dd44bd8e867a910c8172cf.md) and [Kodron Blackheart](Kodron%20Blackheart%2060f8eb51761d4b8eb60af0fff8d24e2a.md) did perform the ritual in [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md) and the result ended up in conflict between [Brand](Brand%20607d655e23dd44bd8e867a910c8172cf.md) of the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) and [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md). Brand took the power of Adam within himself unleashing the madded power of the Vermillion Emperor.

With time and the help of [Ajax](Ajax%20e80cc5051c3f401bb0c84a59d5083fdb.md), the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) managed to restore Adam to an [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) body was locked away in Aeternite for millennia.

### **Relationships and History**

[Adam, Vermillion Emperor](Adam,%20Vermillion%20Emperor%201fea2934606a4cfba108aef2a65405f9.md) and [Ajax](Ajax%20e80cc5051c3f401bb0c84a59d5083fdb.md) studies and learns the ways of the world. They figured that the [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) souls of old, are now shattered in thousands of parts and still forming part of the soul cycle. 

The Vermillion ritual was proof that a soul can be brought back together, of course replicating it in mass would be quite difficult. They studied the [Ashen Elf](Ashen%20Elf%20242958fba0aa4fbcb32c3ddfb19e4353.md) revival through [Graav (God of Death)](Graav%20(God%20of%20Death)%20d63b83eee74f4e1c9db355255ee1a0a0.md)’s power. Soul Transference of the [Onakei](Onakei%2075acc5f4bb134fe5b9cc4e4d6c12b99d.md), they researched the ways of the Pale one who seems to control his soul at will. And of course, the Vermillion Ritual itself, now performed was the base of something new.

[Adam, Vermillion Emperor](Adam,%20Vermillion%20Emperor%201fea2934606a4cfba108aef2a65405f9.md) and [Ajax](Ajax%20e80cc5051c3f401bb0c84a59d5083fdb.md) would both set off on a journey to try and bring some of their people back to build a new society.
