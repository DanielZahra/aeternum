# Nosferatu

- Vampires that came out of nowhere, some believe they originated from the Shadowlands.
- The Nosferatu are not immortal they age and die as much as the other races, however, they have a special ritual of transference that allows them to 'control' their souls at the time of death. They can possess a living being in range or any other being, they can do this within 24 hours of their demise.
- They do this by moving their souls to the [Ethereal Plane](Ethereal%20Plane%20b1f9605fddc34e65ba11ce458e0e6c97.md) so anyone wanting to kill them needs to find a way to trap their soul before it possesses some on new.
- Some of them have carefully lived for centuries or maybe more with this method.
