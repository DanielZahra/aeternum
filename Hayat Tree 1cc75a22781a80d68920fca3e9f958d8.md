### Summary

Native tree like creature from the depths of the [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md). These tree are sometimes called life trees.

The Hayat tree while looking like a tree is very much alive and they tend to bond with a single sentient being that serves as their medium to the  emotions of the world around them. The medium can touch the tree’s bark and emotionally communicate with it. At the core of the tree one can see a large heart made out of fleshy and grassy like substances.

When a Hayat tree’s  branches and roots merge with the soil, it can control a decent size area around it, this allows a single Hayat tree to change the its own ecological area. The older and greater the tree the bigger the range it controls.

### Legends

Stories about the Hayat Trees are plenty. One of the most common one is that skilled alchemists can use the roots and branches of a Hayat tree to create trees that act like Golems or Soldiers. Several cases of this have been recorded but the methods are a secret.

### Flora

One can argue that a Hayat tree is more a plant than a creature. Fellintran druids have always treated this a tree as a very invasive species as it takes over whatever part of a woods or forest it is in.
