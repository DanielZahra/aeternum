# Lapis De Fortuna

'Lapis De Fortuna' stands for the Stones of Fortune. A shitty name given that these stones or giant rocks in the Astral Plane, bordering the Far Planes and are probably the worst place to be. A high-security detention centre for any creature you can imagine, from farmers to the most dangerous monsters.

[Psionic](Psionic%208302f0efd60244b1be7a22191f32ac32.md) creatures and survivors of the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md) created this place kidnapped all manners of creatures and started a bloody business out of it. The Caretakers or Jailers of this place are called the [Blood Coin Creed](Blood%20Coin%20Creed%20a1e3f2b651b049cd88877892c939b8b1.md) , a large group of powerful [Psionic](Psionic%208302f0efd60244b1be7a22191f32ac32.md)s under the control of a [Cuggax the Unassailable](Cuggax%20the%20Unassailable%20c67debd8831d4fc98a04a6549a23ec9e.md).

The prisoners are used as disposable mercenaries and sent to do the dirty work for those willing to pay. The prisoners cannot even consider betraying [Cuggax the Unassailable](Cuggax%20the%20Unassailable%20c67debd8831d4fc98a04a6549a23ec9e.md)  as the psionic powers monitor their every thought and any attempt to escape or betrayal will be met with death.

The prison is split into 10 different divisions ranging from relatively tame prisoners to the most dangerous ones. No one really knows how the place actually operates so efficiently, but the Blood Coin Creed probably has some of the most advanced Plane Shifting and Teleportation magics, and they execute their orders with brutal efficiency.

The 1st division is for people who have been unlucky enough to end up on the wrong side of a deal, this is the laxest area in the prison as the prisoners themselves are mostly harmless and treated as non-dangerous. The area is guarded by a token amount of jailers.

The 2nd division is reserved for prisoners that have seen some combat and might try to attempt and fight their way out. Still not treated as dangers, they are guarded by a token amount of jailers and a couple of dangerous creatures to put some fright in their hearts.

The 3rd division is where security starts becoming more serious and specific prisoners are locked into separate cells, those with magical abilities are also contained and their powers dampened. The guards here are trained to subdue or kill and ask questions afterwards.

The 4th division is built differently, each prisoner here gets assigned multiple guards to make sure they don't mess around. The guards are chosen specifically to deal with the prisoners they are assigned to and trained to deal with them.

The 5th division is built with kill switches, all prisoners have their abilities locked and are monitored constantly. The guards watching them are highly trained to shut them down.

From the 6th to the 10th Divisions, the cells are specifically designed to hold, the prisoners. Every single inmate is treated as a critical-level danger. They are bound, restricted and kept in the most uncomfortable environments to make sure they don't lash out. Some of the most dangerous individuals and or monsters are kept here.
