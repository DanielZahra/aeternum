### Summary

The home of the [Cartwright Mining Company](Cartwright%20Mining%20Company%20f79f9b33748f47138ae14b4630685d49.md), and the ‘central’ hub of the railway network in the underground of [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md).

The city has rails going in 8 directions, the 4 cardinal directions, and 4 intercardinal directions of the compass. These rails then split off into hundreds of not thousands of directions built of more than a thousand years of sweat, blood, and tears of the Cerulians.

The vast majority of the people here respect the [Cartwright Mining Company](Cartwright%20Mining%20Company%20f79f9b33748f47138ae14b4630685d49.md) but of course, with their money and power, they also made a lot of enemies. 

[Railforge](Railforge%20636860fcabe440b085c251c97af3d2b0.md) is an extremely old metropolis and has been around since around 1900 and grew in the Golden Age.
