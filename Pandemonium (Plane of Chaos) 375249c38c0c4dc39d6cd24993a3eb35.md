Plane: Astral Plane, Plane of Chaos

On the Eastern side of the Planar Map lies the Plane of Chaos also known and Pandemonium and home of the Pandemoniums. The Plane of chaos lies between the plane of light and darkness. This place is known to not be a static one and there is constant change and absolute madness at all times.

The lands of chaos are impossible to chart. What wild explorer that actually went to the chaos and came back state is that the lands of chaos are a large number of floating pieces of lands where flora and fauna is wild and crazy. One piece of land you might have extreme heat and one next to it,  might be arctic.

All these 'islands' are also in constant motion as if floating in a sea.
