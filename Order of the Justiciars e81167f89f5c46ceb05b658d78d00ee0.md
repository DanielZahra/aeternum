# Order of the Justiciars

Tags: Universal

Within the ranks of the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) are the Juisticiars. one can argue that they are probabaly the most loyal arm of the church and some of the strongest and smartest military forces around.

The numbers of the Justiciers are almost exculisvely made up of people that were taken in orphans or babies and raiused by the church’s military arm. Trained from when they were young they know the word of the church and treat it as law. A good chunk of the people treat the Juisticiars as extremists of the church as they’re willing to go to extreme lengths to get their jobs done. Their loyaltly is almost unshakable, especially since they spend their entire lives within the ranks of the church.

Most of the Jusiticars take their first name from a figure in the church and they chose their own surname in their coming of age at around 16 to 18 years old. Usually their chosen surnames is aligned with how they fight, or channel the divine powers to serve their purpose.
