# Seers of the Black Lagoon

Tags: Dragon Lands

A shamanistic group of people that live on the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md). These people understand the power of the Dragon Constellation and have been trying to control the ‘anger’ of the volcanic chain for many generations.

Their methods seem to work to a certain extent, however, they lead a tough life and tipping this balance will easily destroy their way of life. The seers live uncomfortably close to the volcanoes of [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md) and their village is nestled and protected by the same Volcanic rock that has been sedimented over many years.

### Dragon Constellation

The seers understand that when the Dragon Star Constellation is aligned perfectly with the heart of one of the Volcanoes present on the island. The Volcanic energy is agitated and it causes sporadic eruptions.

The seers have devised rituals to ‘calm’ the land and they change the savage eruptions into milder ones that do not cause shifting of the tectonic plates themselves.

There is much that isn’t understood but nobody can doubt that the methods work. 

Every time the seers perform this ritual, there is a danger that some of them don’t come back. The fact that they have to travel to the heart of a semi-active volcano while staying away or fighting any monsters that are within the area is a dangerous risk.

### Seer Community

Within the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md) village, many young people are trained to be seers, but it is always the older ones that take on the missions to go to the volcanoes. They cannot have the young ones die too quickly.
Like the other people of the [Dragon Lands](Dragon%20Lands%20ce9140f993044a80964a1b2ba0eb025a.md). The seers are no different, they prefer to keep away from the business and politics of the other nations.

### The Vermillion King’s Legend

The seers pass on a story of how the island chain came to be. The Legend of the Vermillion Dragon mentioned that once upon a time when the [Dragon Lands](Dragon%20Lands%20ce9140f993044a80964a1b2ba0eb025a.md) was a tyranny, a particularly strong emperor known as the Vermillion King left a legacy for the [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) people, it has been written and rewritten multiple times and nobody knows the original or what exactly happened.

The legend mentions that in his time the Vermillion King was the strongest of the [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) people. A true dragon that could soar in the skies and demonstrate the full might of the Dragon Lands. Of course, being powerful means you make enemies and eventually the Vermillion King found his match. 

In the sea around [Valkoria](Valkoria%2063188c93864440e591a3528e50868ec6.md) and the [Dragon Lands](Dragon%20Lands%20ce9140f993044a80964a1b2ba0eb025a.md), a large sea battle took place. An entire fleet from the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) sought to end the Vermillion King’s reign. The battle lasted a very long time and the results were as devastating as they were spectacular. The entire fleet lay decimated, burning and sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Unfortunately, the Vermillion King wasted the end of his powers as he set himself down to end his reign.

His death was in the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md). Many years after, the volcanoes formed. It is believed that even in death his power of spirit still remains. The volcanoes and the dragon constellations are still a symbol of this. But most of all, there are many that are born under his sign. Freak accidents or strange events with fire and heat. Those people bear these marks but grow stronger for it.

The legend ends by mentioning that if these people find each other and pray together to the King himself, they will be granted his power and they will carry on his legacy. How this legend ends is a story that is not yet written as as far as history is concerned, no group has ever managed to come together and perform the ritual or prayer.

### Archer Clan of Fellintra

The [Seers of the Black Lagoon](Seers%20of%20the%20Black%20Lagoon%2041eb5baaa79240569f9d652eb7e18087.md) had a special connection with another clan from Fellintra. The Archer clan came seeing knowledge about the dragon constellation many moons ago. History indicates that they came from Fellintra through Bhadir’s portal. Once they arrived to the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md) they befriended the people and planted an apple tree of friendship and shared their knowledge about stars and magic. 

The tree was special and strong, it survived many generators and the Archer clan could travel through the tree and pay regular visits. The trigger for this long journey was the [Burning of the Evergreen Glade](Burning%20of%20the%20Evergreen%20Glade%20284441c1fc7349faa62086ce42bf4575.md) . The Archer clan came looking for answers, as when the event happened the Dragon Constellation was at its full might. Unfortunately, there was never really a solution or much of an answer but the friendship between the clans remained for a  very long time.

Unfortunately when the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md)  happened, this communication stopped for some time, the tree died and no new seers had travelled back and forth between [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md) and the Archer Clan’s home so the bridge was gone. The Archer clan was said to have a great repertoire of knowledge about the stars but it is not known what happened to it following the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md) .
