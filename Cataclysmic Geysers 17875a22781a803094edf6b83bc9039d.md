# Cataclysmic Geysers

[Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md) has a peculiar geographic phenomenon, these is called the  [Cataclysmic Geysers](Cataclysmic%20Geysers%2017875a22781a803094edf6b83bc9039d.md). When water from the oceans slows drips in the underground, forms rivers and lakes, there is sometimes a massive surge of energy, heat, and water.

These extremely powerful surges or gysters gush from the underground and penetrate all the ground layers, ultimately reaching the oceans above. The force is so powerful that the oceans above don’t drip down and create a one-way water. These geysers often are found in location where the water flow from the surface and the geyser is equivalent so the flow is ‘non-stop’.

When the Geysers do stop, the pressure from the oceans above usually cause massive quakes and floods in the caverns below. Lucky the weight and pressure of the above water does not allow the holes left by the geysers to be open for very long.

## Power of Water

The Geysers are no joke, in fact any creature that would think that this geyser is a short cut to the service would have their life cut short as the power of the water would tear them apart in an instant. 

### Origin

Scientists and Arcanists have studied these geysers from many centuries but none have found the exact reason why such force is applied to this water, nor has anyone survived a journey to the core of [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md) to find their origin. Of course, speculation is always born of ignorance of superstition but some say that at the core of Cerulia is an enormous Titan that is infused with the power of the [Summer Plane ‘Belt of Fire’](Summer%20Plane%20%E2%80%98Belt%20of%20Fire%E2%80%99%2064f5fa8a86144095b4ff4de2bb20a7da.md).
