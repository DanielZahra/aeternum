### Summary

Emberdeep is  one of the largest settlements in Cerulia. The city’s outer core is a large cylindrical downward cavern (about a kilometre wide) that has been dug and formed over millennia. 

The city got its name from the dimly lit crystals found in the rocks here, which have the colour ember. Originally, the digging process started to ship these ember rocks to other settlements, but the workers formed a tight-knit community and settled here instead. Eventually this turned into a massive and bustling community with it’s own and unique culture. The additions of the underpasses that came from [Railforge](Railforge%20636860fcabe440b085c251c97af3d2b0.md) has allowed with city to prosper.

With the addition of a [Gates of Transmission](Gates%20of%20Transmission%204d5f49eec8164e2eb80303376842f284.md), the city is now also one of the main entry ways into the underground of [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md) from the other realms. [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) is split into many layers, in general the citizen also live in a very split social status. The rich and mighty usually will live in the upper area of Emberdeep while the poor will live below.

### Architecture

[Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) famously has 60 levels or stories. With the 60th level being the top of the metropolis while 0 is the ground floor where the magma rivers are found. Moving between these levels can be done by steps or by using the lifts if you’re willing to pay. The top 10 ‘levels’ form the [Skyforge](Skyforge%2018675a22781a8045ba28c6b7ac145041.md). The 11 to 40 levels or middle levels form the [Ember Crossing](Ember%20Crossing%2018675a22781a80ac8883dad512cc1278.md) while the bottom 20 levels contain both the [Underforge](Underforge%2018675a22781a8049898fd09aa61c74c8.md). Anything that is within the vicity of [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) but not within the bounds of the city proper is called the outskirts.

The levels all vary in height as some have some high clearing with more airspace, however the city itself is very symmetrical when it comes to diameter which is about 2 kilometres per level. Between the levels there always a good amount of rock left to maintain the stability of the city itself. There are are also a good number of magically reinforced pillars which also contribute to the stability of the city.

### Traversing Embderdeep

On average to move between each level of Emberdeep one needs about 15 mins of walking up or down the steps. To save you the need of an abacus, this means that within about 15 hours you can go from the pits to the top of Skyforge. Most folk would not try to do this is one go and often stop for a drink or two on the way or for a full night’s sleep.

[Skyforge](Skyforge%2018675a22781a8045ba28c6b7ac145041.md)

Skyforge refers to the upper levels of [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md). While no sky can be seen in [Umbra](Umbra%207f340c9a24ce450cb2d96e5fe3f424a1.md) in the clearing of Emberdeep and its surrounding cavern and fact that you can see the entirety of the below spire is how the upper levels of the city got the name Skyforge. The folk that live here are usually the richest group of the people of [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md).

# [Ember Crossing](Ember%20Crossing%2018675a22781a80ac8883dad512cc1278.md)

[Ember Crossing](Ember%20Crossing%2018675a22781a80ac8883dad512cc1278.md)

The [Ember Crossing](Ember%20Crossing%2018675a22781a80ac8883dad512cc1278.md) is the middle layer of [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md), this is where the vats majority of the people within the city live. Lots of shops, inn, factories and homes are found here. Most of the direct rails, bridges and roads leading in and out of Emberdeep pass straight through Ember Crossing.

# [Underforge](Underforge%2018675a22781a8049898fd09aa61c74c8.md)

[Underforge](Underforge%2018675a22781a8049898fd09aa61c74c8.md)

The [Underforge](Underforge%2018675a22781a8049898fd09aa61c74c8.md) is the opposite of [Skyforge](Skyforge%2018675a22781a8045ba28c6b7ac145041.md). This heavy industrial area is where the poorest people live. Rife with gangs, criminals and some would say almost a lawless part of the city.  The underforge serves as a massive underbelly for [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md).

Most people try to avoid the Underforge mainly as there are a lot of gangs that will often fight in the streets. unfortunately the [Emberguard](Emberguard%2018275a22781a806cb27adda3a65bbad1.md)’s presence is not as strong in this district.

# Society

Emberdeep is primarily and Dwarven settle and all the nobility is part of a dwarven clan. The city of course is very commercial and sees a large number of traffic from every species.

[Emberguard](Emberguard%2018275a22781a806cb27adda3a65bbad1.md) 

The protectors of [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) are called the Emberguard and they only respond to the Emberlord. While their job is to protect the city’s people, more often than not their eyes are set on the mid and upper parts of the city and the lower levels are often left a bit on their own which makes them sometimes lawless. This hasn’t stopped the Emberguard from purging the lower levels every now and then as a show of force. The Emberguard is split into 3 factions or groups, the Goldguard, the Silverguard and the Copperguard, this reflected in their uniform and equipment.
