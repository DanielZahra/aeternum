### Summary

Precious few met a Behemot and survived to tell the tale. Every single part of this monster's body can be considered a dangerous weapon.
Legends say that they are somehow related to the now-extinct titans.

Living in the caverns of Cerulia, these creatures  bull charge and destroy houses, walls and everything else inbetween.
