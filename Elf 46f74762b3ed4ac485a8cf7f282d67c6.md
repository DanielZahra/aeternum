# Summary

The elves are split into 2 different ancestries. The [Ashen Elf](Ashen%20Elf%20242958fba0aa4fbcb32c3ddfb19e4353.md)s came from the [Fellintran Elf](Fellintran%20Elf%20beccd90e1d7446078ec525d40007b5ca.md) but their physical differences now have them seperated as 2 peoples. The [Pale Elf](Pale%20Elf%20f2b604f694fe4bd2a9e78480a2b535e0.md)s are physically diffrent and have come to Aeternum alongside the [Psionic](Psionic%208302f0efd60244b1be7a22191f32ac32.md)s.

Most elves can be easily recognizerd by their pointed ears and sharp features, usually having visibly high cheekbones, a defined jawline, prominent browbone.
