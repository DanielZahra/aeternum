# Aezatan

Playable: NPC Only

Those who controlled the Azaetan Dynasty. They were larger humanoid with advanced skills in magic and technology. They were the masters of their world until their highly religious society turned on the gods and thought they could usurp them.

From looking at the Azaetans, you would think that the modern-day giants are their descendants, which would not be far  off. When the gods eliminated their Dynasty not every single one was removes, they were however diminished and their powers altered forever.

### Physical

Physically the Azaetans had a lot of resemblance to modern day human, dwarves, yet their size resembled more the titanborn. They embodied, the symmetrical limbs of human, the heighted senses and affinity of the magic of the elves and the muscle bulk of the strongest of the dwarves. Of course they tower over most races but are a smaller than the modern [Titanborn](Titanborn%20cfc56316494e4efeb581fb61e10eabab.md) but fairly close to the [Jotun](Jotun%20854ab2adba3d4ce09e6d2109bb4651e5.md). (No historical records prove this, but it is believed that when being smitten down by the gods and losing their Azaetan Heritage, some of the giants naturally compensated by growing a bit bigger in size and physical strength)

### Magical

The Azaetans wielded almost unlimited Arcane and Divine magics the Azaetans. Infact  their society was based on the principles of magic. Every single one of them was gifted in magic and would rival the best practitioners in modern times. However this power was their downfall. When the gods decided to limit their potential and diminish their magical powers they went through a lot of hardships but that allowed them to harness Blood Magic which allowed them to use their own life force to spew more power. Of course they knew the risks.

They treated magic as a fuel and way of advancement and it was used in almost every part of their life. Their work, life, buildings, travelling, everything worked through magic. It's not unconceivable to think, that they would try to go to war against the gods when their very way of life was at risk.

### Magic Augmentation

They augmented their bodies with magical parts and this was a controversial and opinions were very divided. Some of them would remove their eyes and replace them with crystal magical artifacts that gave them sight beyond sight. Some replaced their legs to move faster, etc

### Culture

**Soul Extermination**

The [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) dynasty had a special way of dealing with horrible crimes, seeing as their people would be reborn, prisons were not worth much. When someone would commit an unspeakable crime, their soul would be completely annihilated in a process called soul extermination. This ensured that they were dead and would not be reborn. 

### Aeternite

The Azaetans were the creators of Aeternite and they used to power their magical civilizations. This magical metallic compound can conduct pure magic from one source to another or store it. The method of its creation is lost, but people still find it to this had spread across the land.

### The Titan War

Modern society doesn't have more information about what happened to the ancient titans, the answer to this question remains with the Azaetans. As they lived in the same world, the Titans and the Azaetans lived in harmony.

It is said that the Gods went to war against the Azaetans and over hundreds of years of brutal fighting, the Azaetans lie broken and divided. However when the Azaetans learnt that the titans could be harvested for their power and said power might match the gods, the war was extended and became more brutal. This lead to the gods to destroy the Azaetan Dynasty in almost its entirety. As if that were not enough, the gods broke the soul of all dead Azaetans so they would not be reborn in the cycle.

Following this brutality and destruction, gods changed the worlds for more balance creating the planar realms and races, slowly over thousands of years.

### New Age Azaetans

While they lost their quasi immortality, the soul of the Azaetans is not like that of other mortals. When their souls go into the Soul Cycle, they remains whole, strong and when they are reborn as a new creature they will quickly regain their knowledge and power.

This is a secret that is guarded extremely well by the church of the Twelve. They inherirted the will of the gods and are to exterminate any Azaetans that somehow escaped the Annihilation in the Titan War. One known case of this was, the one known as Adam that managed to free himself at a great cost from one of the Aeternite Capsules in now Yamagato. His injuries did not allow him to live long but he was Reborn as the Vermillion Emperor, a Tyrannical Dragon of extreme power that terrorized the material plane for many years until finally he was put down by the church of the 12.

### Lost Lore

The Azaetans were the closest living beings to resemble the Eternals in their age. Perhaps the gods thought they could do better, little did they know that they would follow the same path.
