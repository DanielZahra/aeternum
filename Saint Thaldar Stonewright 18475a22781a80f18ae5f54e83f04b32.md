### Summary

In life Thaldar was a common man who believed in helping those that needed it. Thaldar was a follow of [Yerus (God of Trade)](Yerus%20(God%20of%20Trade)%20623726752a654b718d239472d434a151.md). 

An unfortunate accident in the lower parts of [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) took Thaldarâ€™s family from him. As a stonemason by trade. Seeing the shambles of how the lower parts of Emberdeep were. Thaldar took it on himself to devote his life to the church and helping the poorer people of Emberdeep maintain their rocky halls and homes and making sure accidents are avoided where possible.

### Saintification

A few years after this death, the people of [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) and the [Church of the Twelve](Church%20of%20the%20Twelve%20a51ac19679214ca0b7344cddc3961507.md) within Emberdeep collectively gathered and named Thaldar as patron of the city and shortly after he was given the title of saint officially.
