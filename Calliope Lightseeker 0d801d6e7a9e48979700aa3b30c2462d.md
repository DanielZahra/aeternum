### Summary

[Astellios Lightseeker](Astellios%20Lightseeker%209df94ac6f30949a69dd6c024e821df50.md) ’ mother and ambassador for Stellaria in Lycia. She moves between Stellaria and Lycia frequently to ensure relations with Lycia remain strong. She officially takes a neutral stance on Lycian Unification but internally she is in favour of it (though [Stefanos Lightseeker](Stefanos%20Lightseeker%20c1f3e3aeb4b64f23b01036e85a984da6.md)  is unaware of this). Astellios is aware of his mother’s opinion since he often visits her alone in Lycia when he can.

Following the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md), and [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md) forcefully dragging [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md) into the war resulting in them officially joining [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md). 

During the confusion in [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md) Calliope saw her husband and son abducted by [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md)’s troops to make [Astellios Lightseeker](Astellios%20Lightseeker%209df94ac6f30949a69dd6c024e821df50.md) shy away for interfering, this however didn’t stop Astellios form rescuing his family and making Maev Regret her decision. Following this Calliope could not stand to work for Lycia any long and alongside the Lightseeker family, left [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md) and went to live in [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md).

Calliope put her political skills to use and worked mostly with [Klotan V Duskember](Klotan%20V%20Duskember%2099cdd29b24f847adb6a08e08f487b1d3.md) and [Marcus Steeljaw](Marcus%20Steeljaw%2085d3a81781fd4875b63130eac6d909ad.md) to make sure the people of [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) are kept safe and don’t end up as more war victims.

By the end of the war, having seen her family move to [Dawnsreach](Dawnsreach%20761cae0d1e6a43e2ae73a08f7d6fc2ce.md), after a long discussion with the Representatives of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md), she was chosen as the best person to take over the Representative seat in [Dawnsreach](Dawnsreach%20761cae0d1e6a43e2ae73a08f7d6fc2ce.md) and usher a new place for the people of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md)
