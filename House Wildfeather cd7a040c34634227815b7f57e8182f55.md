In the west of the [Queendom of Nyaâ€™Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md) lies a family who has spent centuries creating specialised Blood Magic to control [Aeriegon](Aeriegon%2089102faba0554af4b11d3562118f6da8.md)s for flight.  Of course, they also raise, train and ride these giant creatures into the skies of Runaria. Their Blood Magic control on the [Aeriegon](Aeriegon%2089102faba0554af4b11d3562118f6da8.md) is kept as a close secret only shared with the Queen.
