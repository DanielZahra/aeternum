Shi-Rai Igarashi

### Summary

He started his journey with the Quills when he left his home in [Yamagato](Yamagato%2046d0fc8d09494cf095ac9d96213767c8.md). He had a disdain for the life of war his family followed and he went his own way in search of knowledge and ancient history.

[Yefan Pelkin](Yefan%20Pelkin%204307d9e2606a4d16ae1974c2e91965c2.md), gave him an important mission, he was to recruit some associates and to investigate a quarry where some strange ruins had been unearthed during the excavation. 

Now that he joined the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md), his goal in life is to make a discovery that puts his name down in history.

He has found a living [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md), [Ajax](Ajax%20e80cc5051c3f401bb0c84a59d5083fdb.md) and he’s working with the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) to turn this ‘project’ into something amazing.

### Appearance and Personality

Very pale skin, about 5"7 and light green eyes with jet black hair mark Shi-rai as a strange and unique individual right away. His choice of clothing is also strange, he's always wearing a choice set of leather armor, with black fur trimming, a green cloak and green and red feathers. Around his right eye has a large leather eye patch. He travels around with a cane as it helps him with his limp. He's mostly a pacifist, cheerful and honest He has a thirst for knowledge. 

One of his favorite quotes is ' **Plans are useless, Planning is Essential.**

### Skills, Abilities and Possessions

His Fighting Style is quite unique (he does everything with almost one hand as the right side of his body is not very strong). He built himself a shoulder-mounted crossbow. And owns an arcane pistol called ‘Bianca’.

He has good knowledge of magic and is a capable artisan.

He owns a set of Black Origami Birds which are Imbued with Runic magic to send messages at a very long distance.
