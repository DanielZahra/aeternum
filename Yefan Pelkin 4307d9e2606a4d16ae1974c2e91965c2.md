### Summary

Yefan has been the steward of the Quills for a long time. A long life full of knowledge, exploration and teaching the younger quills the values of such things.

### Appearance and Personality

He is small, even by Gnomish standards. His kind disposition and knowledge, alongside his storytelling skills, can instill a sense of wonder in anybody.

### History

Having aided tremendously the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) with their adventures and also allowed both [Adam, Vermillion Emperor](Adam,%20Vermillion%20Emperor%201fea2934606a4cfba108aef2a65405f9.md) and [Ajax](Ajax%20e80cc5051c3f401bb0c84a59d5083fdb.md) to roam free and find their people, Yefan was getting weary in his old age.

The mantle of Steward of the Quills was handed to [Astellios Lightseeker](Astellios%20Lightseeker%209df94ac6f30949a69dd6c024e821df50.md), Yefan aided the transition for a few months before finally passing away, a peaceful death within the [Dimension Library of the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) ](Dimension%20Library%20of%20the%20@Quills%20of%20Ios%20964b9ec9301c4bab9e070303bf86200a.md).
