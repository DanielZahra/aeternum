Oh mighty Foristra, ruler of the boundless deep,
Whose gentle whispers guide us as we sail,
We bow before your splendor, in reverence we keep,
Grant us safe passage, through storm and gale.

Goddess of the waves, with wisdom vast and true,
We seek your blessings on this voyage we undertake,
In tempests fierce, let your calming presence ensue,
Lead us to shores where peace and safety awake.

Foristra, we beseech you, with hearts sincere and bold,
Watch over us, your humble sailors, as we roam,
In your embrace, may our destinies unfold,
And may your grace guide us safely home.

As stars above, in the night's dark veil,
Illuminate our path, so too, may your light,
Guide us through the tempest's furious wail,
And steer us to shores serene and bright.

Oh, goddess of the seas, in you we place our trust,
Protect us, guide us, in the depths we roam,
With every wave that breaks, with every gust,
We offer our prayers to you, dear Foristra, our maritime home.
