On the far east of the [Thundersnow Tundra](Thundersnow%20Tundra%206fe57e3d5f6e4f33b5a09d52643ab212.md), past [Darkwatch Hold](Darkwatch%20Hold%207803ea5028b24f3b8b40363da2656f3b.md) lies the [Wall of Bones](Wall%20of%20Bones%2022875a22781a80448a68dd85b1c11508.md). This large fortified wall is the last remaining bastion of the people that blocks the way in or out of the [Valley of Bones](Valley%20of%20Bones%2083a2842d8828473bb80ef0d5f42009d8.md).

The warrior of [Darkwatch Hold](Darkwatch%20Hold%207803ea5028b24f3b8b40363da2656f3b.md) come here to stave off the waves of undeath and often try to venture into the valley to recover the remains of their dead allies.
