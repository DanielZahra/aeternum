## Summary

A large [Onakei](Onakei%2075acc5f4bb134fe5b9cc4e4d6c12b99d.md) tribe inhabiting the north westernmost territory of the [Onakei](Onakei%2075acc5f4bb134fe5b9cc4e4d6c12b99d.md) people in [Fellintra](Fellintra%208a284461caa445f9a1c30e2b1477f45e.md). Originally they lived further inland, but following the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md) their previous land is now called the [Starfall Enclave](Starfall%20Enclave%204f3447db194c4256b7e5351cfdf8cf25.md) and living there became impossible.

The tribe now lives happily at the edges of the [Amethyst Sea](Amethyst%20Sea%20f177d6f0b5134c05bd745227de5ecddb.md).
