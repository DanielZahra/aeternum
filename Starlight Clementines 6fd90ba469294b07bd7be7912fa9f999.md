# Starlight Clementines

Tags: Fellintra

These clementines are said to be blessed by [Taxtrix (Goddess of Magic)](Taxtrix%20(Goddess%20of%20Magic)%201f492162a6cb4643a33585e1b88e625c.md) herself. While their light blue colors, make them look sickly, the taste and nutrition they provide are spectacular. They have a good hint of citrus flavour but the aftertaste is somewhat minty and refreshing.
