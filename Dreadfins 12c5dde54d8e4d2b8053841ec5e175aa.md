# Dreadfins

Tags: Water

### Summary

These dangerous fish are known for destroying, biting, and eating everything that moves within their environment. 

Some fishermen have also called them ‘Keelers’ as many stories from fishermen start with a Dreadfin munching on their boat or ship.

A single dreadfin can be killed easily, but when there are many, even the strongest creatures or people will die within seconds to the thousands of bites from these fish.

They can often be seen even from the water's surface as they often jump out of the sea to bite at whatever is close to it.

### Homes & Diet

They will bite and eat almost anything.
