# Equuinox filet mignon

Tags: Valkoria

The Equinox filet mignon is a cut of meat taken from the smaller end of the tenderloin. This is very much a delicacy as the Equunixes are often prized animals that are considered hard workers. An unknown group of people instigated a myth about curses when eating Equuinox meat to protect their farm of animals and their love of Equuinoxes.

This dish is usually served with mashed potatoes and boiled vegetables.
