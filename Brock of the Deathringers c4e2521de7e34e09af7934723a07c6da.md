### Summary

My name is Brock, son of [**Tenerak of the Deathbringers**](Tenerak%20of%20the%20Deathbringers%20b3d1f960f50d43a2a049ed21ceb9f72e.md) , High-Shaman of the Clan and brother to Vogan the chieftain of the Deathbringers. Under my father's tutelage, I have learnt the ways of Shamanism and learnt the teaching of Graav the god of Death.

Where I come from death is a common sight, too common and my job is to make sure that those souls that meet it, rest well and those that don't deserve it can stay alive and fight another day.

I took Magda as my wife at the young age of 18 and she gave me 3 beautiful sons, Xuk, Volar and Torog, that was 40 years ago. These boys are now full-fledged warriors for the clan. These boys and my pride and joy and watching them makes my heart full of pride.

We hail from Darkwatch Hold, most would consider this place a shit-hole. We watch the Valley of Bones and fight the undead every day to stop them from ruining more land. Our life here is fighting, frigid tundra and unyielding cold. Our neighbours in the Thundersnow Tundra spend more time fighting each other, than they do sleeping and resting. Times are tough, but the Deathbringers are tougher.

My brother and father are leaders for our people, I try my best to support them but I lack the power and the leadership skills to do it. Hopefully, when the time comes I will be able to take my father's place. Luckily, politics don't matter here we're happy to see another day, survival is our goal.

### Skills, Abilities and Possessions

Apart from my armor and equipment, I don't have much with me here. Luckily, I had my horn on me the day I was kidnapped. If we do end up hurting or killing others, I can send their soul to the astral sea into the flow of chaos where change is inevitable.

I can brew a mean Schnapps and that kept me going in the old nights of winter. I haven't had the time to do much else. If hard work was a skill, that's something my people would be very good at.

Of course, everyone loves a good drink and card games. But not gambling real valuables, that is bad for the soul.

While I spend most of the time, in the backline and not in the thick of the fighting, I still trained with the warriors every day and these old bones can hold their own in a fight. As a Shaman, I will channel what divine powers Graav gives me to aid my allies and destroy my enemies.

### **Relationships and History**

A simple outing was all it took to ruin my life or what I knew of life. Visiting a long friend's grave. I closed my eyes to focus, as I always do.

A blow to the head from the back and I remember is waking up in this strange prison, with a headache that I cannot explain. I would think the other prisoners were completely mad if they didn't call agree in the fact that we're in some Astral Plane prison. They told me we will be sent on missions and we don't get to choose.

I would resist, this dishonourable thing but whatever is implanted in my head is showing my visions of my children dying if I don't comply. For the time being, I will suffer in their stead.
