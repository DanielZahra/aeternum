The [Forgeborn](Forgeborn%20bc063bad27a6430d94a7bda0638c9f4b.md) have a large variety in their bodies and they are semi constructs, they arenâ€™t golems. They still have their own minds, feeling and emotions and a lifespan. Their emotions are however, somewhat different than any other species and as a result they are often misunderstood.
