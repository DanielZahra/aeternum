### History and Events

In the year 3210 NA, many years after the [Crimson Death](Crimson%20Death%2042989249cf7c48ebbc9f3a256ca4cf38.md) was thought to have been extinct, the entire populace of the town was found dead in lumps of red sand, which is believed to be the Crimson Death's effect.

With everyone dead and no one getting close, the town has been abandoned and considered cursed ever since.
