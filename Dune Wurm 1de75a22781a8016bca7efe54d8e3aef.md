# Dune Wurm

Tags: Land, Underground
Creature Family: Worms

### Summary

Dune Wurms are feared for swallowing their prey whole. Many travellers have seen this slow agonizing end as they get digested in the innards of the worms.

The Wurms have no eye sight but have incredible tremor sense and are very sensitive to sounds.

These Wurms can also dive into sand and ‘launch’ them selves in the air to attack their prey by surprise.
