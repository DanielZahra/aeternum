Yamagato is known as the far eastern land in Runaria. Divided into a lot of self-governed sates led by the clans with their own ruling bodies and always fighting each other with a strict code of conduct called the ‘Way of the Warrior’ or ‘***Bushidō’.***

Yamagato has no queens, kings or overarching leaders. The land is divided between the 99 clans, these clans all own lands, army, trade, and their own rules, and customs. When troubles arise between the clans, they are solved with honorable and planned combat.

If a clan decides to break these rules they can expect retribution from several other clans. This fear is what has kept ***Bushidō*** way working for thousands of years. This doesn’t stop some clans from trying to break the rules but in general, most clans stick to the Way of the Warrior.

The clans are smaller in size which means they don’t have the means their resources are limited when compared to the large countries in other continents. Everything within the Land of a Clan belongs to the clan, which means the soil, the food, money, and wild animals.
