Her name was erased from the official story. This book brings back her story in written form and explains how, and when there was a 4th Valkorian Vestige in the history of Valkoria which was mostly kept a secret until the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md).

**The Bold text below is the additions that were omitted from the Sunstriker Legends Volumes. The below is of course a very abridged version.**

### Chapter 1: The Beginning

The village of Ostia lay nestled in a fertile valley, surrounded by fields of golden wheat that stretched as far as the eye could see. Long shadows over the cottages and winding dirt paths. The air was filled with the scent of freshly baked bread and the distant hum of bees buzzing among the wildflowers. In a small, modest home on the outskirts of the village, a boy sat by the window, his eyes fixed on the horizon. His name was Valkorian, though most in the village called him Val. At ten years old, he was tall for his age, with a mop of unruly dark hair and eyes the color of an emerald. There was a restlessness in him, a yearning for something beyond the peaceful life his parents had made for him.

His mother, Elysia, stood by the hearth, stirring a pot of stew. She glanced over at her son, a knowing smile playing on her lips. She had seen that look before, in his father’s eyes when he had been a boy. “Daydreaming again, Val?” she asked gently.

Valkorian blinked, pulled from his thoughts. “I’m not daydreaming, Mama,” he said, though there was a slight flush to his cheeks. “I’m just…thinking.” “Thinking about what, my little warrior?” Elysia teased, though there was no mockery in her tone. Valkorian hesitated, then turned to his mother with a seriousness that seemed beyond his years. “Do you think…do you think I’ll ever be like him?” Elysia’s hand paused mid-stir, her heart tightening in her chest. She knew who he meant. She crossed the room and knelt beside him, her hands gentle on his shoulders. “Like your father?” she asked softly. Valkorian nodded. “He was a hero, wasn’t he? Everyone in the village says so. They tell stories about how he fought in the wars, how he was brave and strong. They say he was a great paladin, Mama. I want to be just like him.”

Elysia looked into her son’s earnest eyes and felt a pang of both pride and sorrow. Yes, his father had been all those things. Darius Sunstriker had been a man of great honor and courage, a paladin devoted to the god of war, Ravana. But he had also been a man who had seen too much, who had fought too many battles. He had given his life in service to others, and in doing so, had left a void in the lives of those who loved him. “You have your father’s spirit,” Elysia said, brushing a strand of hair from Valkorian’s face. “But you are your own person, Val. You don’t have to follow in his footsteps to honor him.” “But what if that’s what I want?” Valkorian’s voice was quiet, but there was a determination in it that Elysia couldn’t ignore. “I want to be strong like he was. I want to protect people, to fight for what’s right.” Elysia sighed softly, pulling her son into a hug. “If that’s what you truly want, Val, then I won’t stand in your way. But remember, being strong doesn’t just mean being able to fight. It means knowing when to fight and when to walk away. It means protecting those who can’t protect themselves and standing up for what you believe in, even when it’s hard.”

Valkorian nodded against her shoulder, absorbing her words. “I’ll remember, Mama. I promise.” As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the valley in hues of pink and orange, Valkorian sat quietly in his mother’s embrace. He could still hear the villagers' tales of his father echoing in his mind, and though he was just a boy, he felt the stirrings of something deep within him—something that told him his destiny lay beyond the fields of Ostia. That night, as Valkorian lay in his bed, he stared up at the ceiling, listening to the soft rustle of the wind outside. His hand clenched around the small wooden sword his father had carved for him before he was born. It was a simple thing, worn smooth by years of play, but to Valkorian, it was a symbol of what he could become. As sleep began to claim him, Valkorian made a silent vow. He would become a paladin, just like his father. He would train hard, learn everything he could, and one day, he would make his own mark on the world. He would be a hero, not just in name, but in deed. And so, as the village of Ostia slept under the watchful gaze of the stars, a young boy dreamed of war—not the bloodshed and chaos, but the glory, the honor, and the chance to make a difference in a world that would one day come to know his name. For Valkorian Sunstriker, the journey had only just begun.

### Chapter 2: The Gathering of Heroes

Twilight dipped low over the horizon, casting a golden hue over the ancient stones of the crossroads. It was here, beneath the towering statue of Ravana, the god of war, that destiny would bring together a band of heroes whose names would be spoken in reverence for generations. Valkorian Sunstriker knelt before the statue, his armor glinting in the fading light. He had traveled far from his home, led by adventures. 

As he finished his prayer, the sound of heavy footsteps reached his ears. Valkorian stood, his hand instinctively moving to the hilt of his sword, Dawnbringer, he named it. Emerging from the nearby forest was an orc, towering and broad-shouldered, with a greatsword slung over his back. His green skin was scarred from countless battles, and his eyes held the fierce determination of a warrior. “Ritter Stavanger, I presume,” Valkorian said, his voice steady. He had been told to expect a companion from the wildlands, a warrior who had earned the respect of friend and foe alike. “Aye, that’s me,” the orc rumbled, his voice deep as the earth. “You must be the paladin I was told about. Ravana called, and I answered.”

As they exchanged nods of understanding, a sudden burst of magical energy crackled in the air. A portal of swirling arcane energy appeared before them, and out stepped a small figure, no taller than a child, yet with an air of wisdom and power that belied his stature. The gnome’s robes were adorned with runes that shimmered in the twilight, and his eyes sparkled with a mischievous glint. “Rain Domarien, at your service!” the gnome declared with a flourish. “I sensed the gathering of powerful auras and knew I had to join. After all, what’s an adventure without a bit of magic?” Valkorian chuckled, sensing the gnome’s good heart beneath his playful demeanor. Before he could respond, the air around them seemed to thrum with divine energy, and a figure glided towards them from the direction of the nearby hills. An elven woman, her silver hair flowing like a waterfall, approached with a serene grace. In her hands, she carried a staff topped with a glowing crystal, and her presence radiated peace and healing.

“Klerana Mavis,” she introduced herself, her voice as soothing as a gentle breeze. “The stars spoke of a great trial ahead, and I knew I must aid those who would face it. The light of the divine will guide our path.” **As the group exchanged greetings, the final member of their party made her entrance. A soft melody filled the air, haunting and beautiful, drawing the eyes of all towards a shadowy figure emerging from the forest’s edge. Clad in dark robes with a violin across her back, the human woman moved with an eerie grace. Her eyes, however, were warm, revealing a soul torn between light and darkness. “Milena Goldleaf,” she said, her voice a whisper that seemed to carry the weight of forgotten songs and ancient secrets. “I bring the melodies of the dead and the living. Together, they will strengthen us.”**

Valkorian surveyed the group before him. An orc warrior, a gnome wizard, an elven cleric, and a human necromancer-bard. They were as different as the elements themselves, yet he could feel the threads of fate binding them together. “We each have our own reasons for being here,” Valkorian said, his voice strong and clear, “but Ravana has brought us together for a purpose. A darkness is rising, and it will take all of us to stand against it. Will you stand with me?” One by one, his companions nodded, their resolve evident in their eyes. “Then let us begin this journey together,” Valkorian declared. “We are no longer strangers but comrades-in-arms. Together, we will forge our legend.” As the light finally dipped below the horizon, the five heroes set off down the road, their footsteps in sync, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. And so, the legend of Valkorian Sunstriker and his companions began—a tale of friendship, courage, and the unyielding light that even the darkest shadows could not extinguish.

### Chapter 3: The Heroes of Meridien

The continent of Meridien was a land of many small dukedoms, ancient forests, and treacherous mountains. It was a place where legends were born, and the deeds of heroes echoed through the ages. Among those legends, none were as renowned as the tale of Valkorian Sunstriker and his companions. Valkorian, now a seasoned paladin of Ravana, led his band of adventurers with unwavering resolve. By his side stood Ritter Stavanger, the orc warrior whose strength was matched only by his loyalty. Rain Domarien, the gnome wizard, brought wisdom and wit to the group, his spells as sharp as his tongue. Klerana Mavis, the elven cleric, wielded the healing light of the gods with grace and precision, **while Milena Goldleaf, the enigmatic necromancer and bard, spun tales and songs that could both enchant and terrify.**

Their journey across Meridien began in the dense forests of Spiralling Woods, where an ancient curse had turned the once-peaceful woods into a place of nightmares. The trees whispered dark secrets, and shadows moved with a life of their own. It was here that the group faced their first true test. The villagers spoke of a monstrous beast, a guardian of the forest twisted by the curse, that terrorized anyone who dared enter the woods. Undeterred, Valkorian and his companions ventured into the heart of  Spiralling Woods. They fought through waves of corrupted creatures, each step closer to the source of the darkness.

In a clearing bathed in eerie moonlight, they confronted the beast—a massive, wolf-like creature with eyes that glowed with malevolent intent. The battle was fierce, but united by purpose and their growing bond, the heroes emerged victorious. Klerana’s healing light banished the curse, restoring peace to the forest. The grateful villagers hailed them as saviors, and word of their deeds began to spread. From the icy peaks of the Now Western Valkorian Mountains to the sun-scorched beaches of the south, Valkorian and his companions faced countless challenges. They defeated bandit lords, unearthed ancient relics, and thwarted the schemes of dark sorcerers. Each victory brought them closer, turning them from mere adventurers into legends. In the grand city of Messana, they uncovered a plot that threatened to plunge the entire continent into chaos. A cabal of rogue mages sought to summon an ancient dragon, long thought to be a myth, to bend it to their will and seize control of Meridien. The heroes infiltrated the mages' stronghold, battling through traps, illusions, and fierce guardians.

In the final confrontation, the rogue mages unleashed the dragon—a colossal, acid-breathing beast that darkened the sky with its wings. Valkorian led the charge, his sword gleaming with divine light as he struck at the creature’s heart. Rain’s spells weaved through the air, confusing and disorienting the dragon, while Ritter’s powerful blows brought it to its knees. Klerana shielded her companions from the dragon’s fiery breath, and **Milena’s haunting melodies sapped the strength from their foes.**

With a final, mighty strike, Valkorian plunged his sword into the dragon’s heart, and with a deafening roar, the beast was defeated. The cabal of mages fell in despair, their dark ambitions shattered. The people of Messana, and indeed all of Meridien, celebrated the heroes' triumph. Songs were sung, and stories were told of the day Valkorian Sunstriker and his companions saved the continent from destruction. Their names were etched into the annals of history, and they became known as the Heroes of Meridien.

But for Valkorian and his companions, the journey was far from over. They knew that as long as there was darkness in the world, their work would never be complete. Together, they would continue to wander the lands of Meridien, seeking out those in need, and facing whatever challenges fate had in store for them. And so, the heroes walked into the sunset, their hearts full of purpose, knowing that their legend would live on long after they were gone.

### Chapter 4: **The Path to Power**

Valkorian Sunstriker, the paladin once known only for his deeds on the battlefield, had become a figure of immense renown across the continent of Meridien. His victories against ancient curses, monstrous beasts, and rogue mages had earned him and his companions a place in the hearts of the people. But as their fame grew, so too did the attention of the rulers of Meridien. It was in the grand city of Messana, the capital of the Dukedome of Ardenfall, that Valkorian's destiny began to take a new turn. The city, with its towering spires and bustling markets, was a beacon of wealth and power. Duke Theodric, a wise and seasoned ruler, had heard of Valkorian’s exploits and saw in him more than just a hero—he saw a potential ally, a leader, and perhaps even a successor.

One evening, Valkorian and his companions were summoned to the duke’s court. The great hall of the royal hall was filled with nobles, courtiers, and advisors, all eager to see the legendary hero. As Valkorian strode down the red-carpeted aisle, his companions at his side, whispers filled the air. Duke Theodric rose from his throne, a smile on his face as he greeted the paladin. “Valkorian Sunstriker, it is an honor to welcome you to Velora. Your deeds have reached even the farthest corners of my kingdom, and I would be a fool not to seek your counsel.” Valkorian bowed respectfully. “Your Majesty, the honor is mine. I am but a servant of justice, doing what I can to protect this land.” The duke’s smile deepened. “And yet, it is clear that your influence extends far beyond the battlefield. Meridien is a land in need of strong leadership, not just in times of war, but in times of peace as well.”

Over the following weeks, Valkorian and his companions became regular guests at the palace. Duke Theodric often sought Valkorian’s advice on matters of state—border disputes, trade negotiations, and even the delicate balance of power between the kingdoms of Meridien. Valkorian, with his keen sense of justice and deep moral compass, proved to be a wise and thoughtful advisor. But the Duke’s interest in Valkorian was not purely political. Theodric had no heir, and as the years passed, he grew increasingly concerned about the future of his kingdom. He saw in Valkorian not just a hero, but a man who could unite the people, a man who could lead with both strength and compassion. One evening, as the twilight set over the city, casting the palace in a golden glow, Duke Theodric invited Valkorian to a private audience. The king’s expression was serious, his eyes thoughtful.

“Valkorian,” he began, “you have proven yourself time and again, not just as a warrior, but as a leader. My dukedom has prospered under my rule, but I am not immortal. I have no son to inherit my throne, and I fear what may happen after I am gone.” Valkorian listened in silence, sensing the weight of the duke’s words. “I have thought long and hard about this,” Theodric continued, “and I believe that you, Valkorian, are the one who should lead Ardenfall after me. You have the respect of the people, the wisdom to rule, and the strength to protect this kingdom from any threat.” Valkorian was stunned. He had never sought power or titles—his life had always been about service, about fighting for what was right. The idea of ruling a dukedom was as daunting as it was unexpected. “Your Majesty,” Valkorian replied carefully, “I am honored by your trust, but I am no king or duke. My place is on the battlefield, not the throne.”

Theodric shook his head. “A duke must be more than just a ruler, Valkorian. He must be a protector, a guide, and a symbol of hope. You are all of these things already. And with the right counsel, with the support of your companions and my advisors, you could be the leader this kingdom needs.” For the first time, Valkorian felt the pull of a different kind of duty. He had always fought for the people, but what if he could do more? What if he could protect them not just with his sword, but with his decisions, his leadership? The idea began to take root in his mind. Days turned into weeks, and Valkorian wrestled with the duke’s offer. He spoke with his companions, seeking their counsel. Ritter was pragmatic, seeing the advantage of having one of their own in a position of power. Rain, ever the strategist, saw the potential to shape the future of Meridien. Klerana believed it was Valkorian’s destiny, **and Milena, with her usual enigmatic smile, simply said, “Power is what you make of it, Valkorian. Just make sure it’s something you can live with.”**

In the end, Valkorian agreed to the duke’s request, though with one condition—that he would not forsake his duty as a protector. He would take up the mantle of leadership, but he would also remain a paladin, ever vigilant against the darkness that threatened Meridien. And so, Valkorian Sunstriker began his journey into the world of politics and power. As he stood on the balcony of the royal halls, looking out over the city of Messana, he knew that his path had taken a new turn. He was no longer just a hero; he was a leader, a symbol of hope for a kingdom that would one day be his to guide. The tale of Valkorian and his companions continued to grow, now intertwined with the fate of a kingdom. And as the winds of change swept across Meridien, the name Valkorian Sunstriker became known not just as a hero of the battlefield, but as a ruler who would one day shape the destiny of an entire continent. 

### Chapter 5: **The Birth of Valkoria**

The lands of Meridien had long been a patchwork of independent duchies, each ruled by a duke or duchess with their own ambitions, their own armies, and their own loyalties. These duchies had existed in a tenuous balance, their rulers content to bicker and squabble, each more concerned with their own domains than with the continent as a whole. But that balance was shattered the day Valkorian Sunstriker took up the mantle of Duke of Messana. Valkorian stood on the battlements of the castle overlooking Messana, the city that now bowed to his will. The wind tugged at his cloak, and the light cast a golden hue over the fertile plains that stretched beyond the city walls. But Valkorian’s thoughts were far from the tranquility of the moment. His gaze was fixed on the horizon, where the other duchies lay—fractured, divided, and vulnerable.

Since taking the title of Duke, Valkorian had swiftly transformed Messana into a beacon of strength and prosperity. He reformed the city’s defenses, expanded its trade routes, and united its people under a banner of justice and progress. The people of Messana revered him, seeing in him not just a ruler, but a visionary—a man who could do what no one else had dared to dream. The other dukes of Meridien, however, viewed Valkorian with a mix of fear and suspicion. Rumors spread like wildfire across the continent—whispers of Valkorian’s ambition, of his desire to see Meridien united under one banner. And those rumors were not unfounded.

In the great hall of his castle, Valkorian met with his closest advisors—his companions who had been with him through every battle and every victory. Ritter Stavanger, the orc warrior who had become his most trusted general, stood by the map table, his massive arms crossed over his chest. Rain Domarien, the gnome wizard, hovered near the table’s edge, his sharp eyes scanning the detailed maps of Meridien. Klerana Mavis, the elven cleric, **and Milena Goldleaf, the necromancer and bard, stood on either side of Valkorian, their expressions reflecting the gravity of the moment.**

“It’s time,” Valkorian said, his voice steady. “The other duchies are weak, divided. We’ve proven that Messana can stand strong, but this continent will never know true peace as long as it remains fractured. Meridien needs a leader—a single ruler to unite the lands and end the constant wars and rivalries.” “And that ruler should be you,” Ritter said with a grunt, his voice a deep rumble. “The other dukes will resist, but they’re no match for our forces. We’ve trained hard, and our armies are ready.” Rain nodded, his fingers tracing the borders of the neighboring duchies on the map. “We’ve already secured alliances with several key cities. The people are tired of the old ways. They want stability, prosperity—something the other dukes have failed to provide.” Klerana, ever the voice of reason, spoke next. “But unification through conquest will not be easy, Valkorian. Blood will be shed, and not everyone will see your vision as the right path. You must be prepared for the consequences.” **Milena, with her usual enigmatic smile, added, “Power is a delicate thing, my friend. Once you seize it, there’s no turning back. But you’ve never been one to shy away from a challenge, have you? Your quest for good will quickly turn red with he blood of your fellow Meridien.”**

Valkorian’s eyes flicked to each of his companions in turn. They had been with him through countless trials, and now they stood ready to follow him into this new, uncertain future. He knew the risks, the potential for bloodshed and betrayal. But he also knew that Meridien needed more than just a hero—it needed a ruler with the strength to unite it. “Our goal is not just conquest,” Valkorian said, his voice firm. “We will bring these lands together, not through fear, but through hope. We will offer the other dukes a chance to join us willingly, to see the vision of a united Meridien—a united Valkoria. But if they refuse, we will do what must be done. For too long, this continent has been torn apart by greed and ambition. It’s time to forge something new, something better.”

And so, the campaign to unite Meridien under the banner of Valkoria began. Valkorian led his forces with the same unyielding determination that had made him a legend. One by one, the duchies fell before him—some through diplomacy, others through force of arms. Cities opened their gates to his armies, their people welcoming him as a liberator rather than a conqueror. Those dukes who refused his terms found themselves outmaneuvered and outmatched, their armies crumbling before the might of Messana. The turning point came at the Battle of Darnak Vale, where the largest coalition of resisting dukes made their stand. The battle was fierce, with both sides suffering heavy losses. But Valkorian’s leadership and the unwavering loyalty of his companions turned the tide. Ritter’s ferocity on the front lines, Rain’s devastating spells, Klerana’s healing light, **and Milena’s dark magic wove together into a symphony of victory, as the dead rose to bolster Valkorian’s troops.**

**This was the first time the people of Meridien saw the power of the [Valkorian Vestiges](Valkorian%20Vestiges%202bb89e3c957d4dd5b92d719ecb912a0b.md), Ritter empowered the troops to fight like med men, an unstoppable force. Rain’s staff and Klerana’s Crown exposed many spies and infiltrators trying to sabotage Valkorian and made sure the allies Valkorians made do not betray him. Milena’s Violin now turned into an artifact of great power allowed Valkorian to move his most elite of troops in a matter of minutes and ambush directly his opponent’s headquarters.** 

When the dust settled, the last of the resisting dukes knelt before Valkorian, swearing fealty to the new order. The continent of Meridien, once divided and chaotic, was now united under a single banner—the banner of Valkoria. Standing on the steps of the newly christened continent, Valkorian gazed out at the gathered crowds. People from every corner of the continent had come to witness the dawn of a new era. Valkorian raised his sword high, the blade catching the light of the setting day. “Today, we are no longer divided by borders or titles,” he declared, his voice carrying over the sea of faces. “Today, we are one people, united under one banner. This land shall henceforth be known as Valkoria—a realm of justice, of peace, and of prosperity. Together, we shall build a future where all can thrive, where all can find their place.” The crowd erupted into cheers, the sound like thunder rolling across the plains. The dream of Valkoria had become a reality, and Valkorian Sunstriker, once a lone hero wandering the wilds, had become the ruler of an entire continent.

But as the cheers echoed across the city, Valkorian knew that his journey was far from over. To unite a continent was one thing; to rule it wisely was another. Challenges lay ahead—political intrigue, rebellion, the ever-present threat of old enemies. But for now, Valkorian allowed himself a moment of pride, knowing that he had forged a legacy that would endure for generations to come. And so, the legend of Valkorian Sunstriker, the first ruler of Valkoria, began—a tale not just of conquest, but of the vision and determination to bring a divided world together under a banner of hope.

**Milena Goldleaf, was still unsure of what was to come next, Valkorian had achieved everything he set out to do but now he turned his eyes outwards as he looked at other continents and win more power for Valkoria.**

### Chapter 6: The Oath of the Shadowlands

**The continent of Kas-Velar was a place of mysteries, its lands shrouded in myths and legends. Of all its regions, none were more feared than the Shadowlands—a desolate, cursed expanse where the light seemed to shy away, leaving the world in perpetual twilight. It was here that Valkorian Sunstriker and his companions ventured, driven by tales of a being known only as the Pale One. The Pale One was said to be an ancient entity, neither living nor dead, with powers that defied comprehension. Rumors spoke of his dominion over life and death, of secrets that could unlock the path to immortality. Valkorian, ever the seeker of justice and truth, had come to put an end to whatever dark influence the Pale One exerted over these lands.**

**But as they ventured deeper into the Shadow Lands, a sense of foreboding grew among the group. The very air seemed to sap their strength, and the shadows moved as if alive. At last, in a crumbling ruin lost to time, they found him—or rather, he found them. The Pale One emerged from the darkness like a wraith, his form tall and impossibly thin, his skin as white as bone. His eyes, cold and luminous, seemed to pierce through to their very souls. Without a word, he descended upon them. The battle that followed was unlike any they had ever faced. Valkorian’s sword, blessed by the god of war, seemed to strike only air. Ritter’s mighty blows were parried with ease, Rain’s spells dissipated against an unseen force, and even Milena’s dark magic had no effect. Klerana’s healing light flickered and dimmed in the presence of the Pale One, as if the very essence of life was being drained from the world around them.**

**One by one, they fell, not dead but defeated, brought to their knees by a power far beyond their understanding. Valkorian, battered and bloodied, struggled to rise, but the Pale One’s gaze held him in place, the weight of ages pressing down upon him. “You have come to destroy me,” the Pale One’s voice was a whisper, like the rustling of dead leaves, “but you know nothing of what I am, nor the truths I hold. I could end your lives here, snuff out your flames as easily as one would a candle.” Valkorian, his spirit unbroken even in defeat, met the Pale One’s gaze. “If you are so powerful, then why let us live? What do you want from us?”**

**The Pale One smiled, a slow, chilling curve of the lips. “Life is a fleeting thing, paladin. You fight for justice, for a world that will forget you as soon as you pass from it. But I offer you something greater—an eternity to shape this world, to guide it, to explore the very fabric of existence itself.” Valkorian’s heart pounded in his chest. He knew the danger of making deals with beings like this, but he also saw the truth in the Pale One’s words. The thought of immortality, of having the power to protect Valkoria for all time, was a temptation like no other. “What do you propose?” Valkorian asked, his voice steady despite the fear gnawing at his soul.**

**“An oath,” the Pale One replied, his voice silky and smooth. “Swear to work with me, to explore the secrets of life and death, to uncover the path to immortality. In return, I will spare you and your companions. Together, we can achieve what no mortal has ever dreamed.” Valkorian hesitated the weight of the decision heavy upon him. He looked at his companions—Ritter, Rain, Klerana —all kneeling in defeat, their eyes reflecting a mix of fear and hope. He knew they would follow him, whatever choice he made. Milena managed to stand up on one leg and screaming “Don’t you dare agree with that monster, you know this won’t end well!”**

**Valkorian shook his head and finally, he spoke. “I swear it. We will work together, but know this—I do this not for power, but for the good of Valkoria. If you betray us, I will find a way to end you, no matter the cost.” The Pale One chuckled and inclined his head, as if acknowledging the terms of the agreement. “Then it is done. Rise, Valkorian Sunstriker, and let us begin our work.” With that, the Pale One faded back into the shadows, leaving Valkorian and his companions alone in the crumbling ruins. The air seemed lighter, the oppressive darkness lifting just slightly. But as they stood, the weight of the oath they had just sworn settled upon them. They had come to destroy a great evil but had instead entered into a pact with it. The path ahead was shrouded in uncertainty, but Valkorian knew that they had crossed a threshold from which there was no return.**

**And so, they left the Shadowlands, their hearts heavy with the knowledge that their quest for immortality had only just begun.**

### Chapter 7: The Seat

**Valkorian and their companions returned to Valkoria and visited one of their old homes in Ordona, here they spent a lot of time studying and reading in secret in the underground of their keep. Milena made he feeling heard she was till in disagreement with all of this but she did not have the heart to betray her lifelong companions. The Pale One was now a regular visitor and within a few years they had what they wanted.  Milena was asked to study the forgotten and learn everything about them, mainly how the speck of a soul they possess allows them to live forever. Her knowledge and power as a Necromancer made her the best choice for this.**

**Valkorian’s eyes were set on following the new oath, and there was no better place to attempt this than his new home and place of power, Valkorian’s Seat. Over the next 5 years, Valkorian’s people built an underground research facility and started running experiments on the forgotten, the Pale one also managed to bring and build a [Gates of Transmission](Gates%20of%20Transmission%204d5f49eec8164e2eb80303376842f284.md) within their underground base. He was helping with the experiment and trying to bring to life what he called the [Risen](Risen%20e28f5205b526454a9cdc49db3e3619d7.md). Milena had come extremely close to find a working solution, how to use the power of the forgotten to allow a man or woman to live an eternal life, but it was elusive and she knew that something was missing.**

**It was already 15 years past when they started this project, Valkorian and the companions in their older years, started families. Their relationships were strong but somewhat diminished over time, the Pale One’s oath inserted a lot of distrust between them. A life of adventuring left Valkorian with a damaged body and sickness was slowly starting to set in. Klerana knew that death was not too far away for him. This perhaps, made him angry and desperate. The once nobleman was now clinging to the Oath made by the Pale One. An opportunity was there, the Pale One was successful in bringing the [Risen](Risen%20e28f5205b526454a9cdc49db3e3619d7.md) to ‘life’ so to speak. Milena knew what he did but the same ritual would not work with living people, it would turn them into undead, that’s not living! she thought.**

**As Milena slowly tried to hide the rituals and results, Valkorian was growing impatient, he called a large meeting on a hill behind the capital in Valkorian’s seat. This is was the first time where she pointed his sword as Milena. “What are you hiding?” he said, “The Pale One gave you everything you wanted, yet you have no results to show.”. Milena took a step back, “Valkorian, you lost your way, I cannot let you unleash this evil on the land.”, as Milena started chanting, not a second passed as Valkorian swung his sword towards her, only realizing he was dealing with an illusion. Frustrated and angered, he looked at the others. “No one leaves the island until we find her”.  The other 3 companions looked at each other in disbelief not sure about what was about to happen, but they didn’t have much time to think, Milena was a craft one, and within seconds, hundreds of Forgotten started to rise and attack Valkorian soldiers. Valkorian’s seat was a mess.**

**Valkorian rushed back to the capital, only to find the Pale One in the underground lab he had built. The Pale One seemed completely unphased by the betrayal. “Ah, a squabble between friends, how sad.” The Pale One said. Valkorian was already enraged and this time he lost all sense of reason. He attacked, the Pale One, missing every single blow, and she commanded the people in the lab to take the [Risen](Risen%20e28f5205b526454a9cdc49db3e3619d7.md) away. This was the only the Pale One, would not accept. A fury came to him, as he unleashed all of his power on Valkorian’s people, but leaving Valkorian alive and watching, suffering to see everything he built fall apart.**

**The Pale One took the Risen, sabotaged the entire lab, and slowly transformed Valkorian’s seat into a mist and forgotten infested island, as all if not all of Valkorian’s people perished. Very few survived these weeks of madness. Left alive, and with his companions, Valkorian managed to hide almost everything that happened and slowly started asking his scribes to erase Milena’s history. He tasked his companions to hunt her down until they had no energy left. Little did he know, that his most faithful companion, Klerana was hiding Milena in her hometown of Isyen Lenora.**

**Nobody knows what happened with the Pale One, and history has taught us that messing with him does not go well.**

As time went by, Valkorian was succeeded by his son, and he died a peaceful death still celebrated as a hero and the one who united the continent of Valkoria. Milena Violin was lost to time but eventually was found and reforged by the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) during the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md), and that story is how this tale could be rewritten and some gaps refilled.

### Extra Chapter: The Mausoleum of Screams

Secreted away under [Duztar’s Step](Duztar%E2%80%99s%20Step%20186ea4cd71c447149950d98abcc3fc92.md), [Milena Goldleaf](Milena%20Goldleaf%20a8fb20aa07314eafb1a906c1cb0a9e8b.md) built herself a mausoleum to experiment and dive deeper into her work as she hid away from Valkorian and his ilk. After many years of experimentation, she managed to merge her soul with a fragment of a forgotten creature. This did, make her immortal, but also drove her insane, and before completely losing her sanity, she locked the mausoleum behind many dangerous challenges hoping that somebody the those seeking the violin would put her out of her misery, which the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) did in the year 3213 NA.
