[Mana](Mana%201f975a22781a80e9a558ce2099c985da.md)  is often used as the word to describe the ‘natural’ sense of magic in Aeternum. Almost all creatures with few exceptions are capable of manipulating mana. This allows people to learn, study use or innately posses magical abilities. Mana is also used when fusing magical qualities in items and activating them. Mana is self replenishing and a natural resource of the world. 

Mana itself is ever-living and present in all corners on the worlds and planes. While most can interact and manipulate mana is is very difficult to master it’s usage without substantial training and experience.

[Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md) is what one would consider the ‘physical form’ of [Mana](Mana%201f975a22781a80e9a558ce2099c985da.md) , which makes the material incredible powerful and important. It is believe that that the ancient [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) people had methods of processing mana into [Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md) but these methods are lost. [Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md)  can be still found in the wild or through ancient relics. 

The process of creating magical items required the use of [Aeternite](Aeternite%20d6bed42b40d342d299f1b7f471b753ee.md).
