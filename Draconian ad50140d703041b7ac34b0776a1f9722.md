## Corrupted Drakes, Wryms or Dragons

Dragonians that give in to the urges for power often end up corrupting themselves. Corrupt draconians not only lose themselves changing their appearance and powers. But they are also shunned and hated by the rest of the Draconian people.

Draconians that become corrupted, are extremely powerful and dangerous and often treated no differently than monsters, even though they possess fierce intellect and magical prowess.
