# Destruction of @Gaia

Age: Age of the Aezatans
Summary: At the Peak of the Aezatan Dynasty, when the Gods decided that the Aezatan people were becoming too dangerous and reckless. According to Adam, Vermillion Emperor (Adam,%20Vermillion%20Emperor%201fea2934606a4cfba108aef2a65405f9.md), Graav (God of Death) (Graav%20(God%20of%20Death)%20d63b83eee74f4e1c9db355255ee1a0a0.md), manifested his physical avatar in close proxity to the Aezatan home planet Gaia (Gaia%2011275a22781a809dba88c61a74e1ad75.md) and drained most of the lifeforce and mana from it, leaving a shattered world wiping out at least half of the Aezatan population with one blow.  This is believed to what really caused the Aezatan people to go on an all out war against the gods.
