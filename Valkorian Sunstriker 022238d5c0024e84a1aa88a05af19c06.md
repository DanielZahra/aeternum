### Summary

The warrior king united the central continent of Runaria after many years of infighting. He wielded legendary powers and was charismatic enough to earn the following of many people.

Born in 2370 NA, Valkorian was a commoner with a good heart and a thirst for adventure. His travels around the world earned him the artifacts now known as the [Valkorian Vestiges](Valkorian%20Vestiges%202bb89e3c957d4dd5b92d719ecb912a0b.md). A sword, circlet (crown) and a staff. He was also a hero to the people and a pretty famous dungeon delver and adventurer before he earned these titles and artifacts.

Later in life, he was known as Valkorian the Conqueror and his demeanour had shifted quite a bit as he was no longer the nice adventurer. But he was the general and king of a large army which committed countless atrocities to unite the continent.

He started the Valkorian Dynasty who ruled Valkoria for many years,

### Skills, Abilities and Possessions

Valkorian worshipped [Ravana (Goddess of War)](Ravana%20(Goddess%20of%20War)%20ef885dcf2dac40bd934703daa3d8b6aa.md) and still plenty do in [Valkoria](Valkoria%2063188c93864440e591a3528e50868ec6.md). This continent has gone to war many times, surely Ravana must be happy.

### **Relationships and History**

**The Companions**

Valkorian didn't rise to fame on his own, he had a whole company of mercenaries and adventurers that helped him along the way. Among those were the closest confidants, 3 of which wielded the powerful items known as the [Valkorian Vestiges](Valkorian%20Vestiges%202bb89e3c957d4dd5b92d719ecb912a0b.md) 

Unknown the most people, there was a 4th close companion who abandoned Valkorian on the cusp of him becoming a conqueror. This 4th companion is believed to have written most of the history surrounding Valkrorian's achievements, but it seems they kept themselves and their identity a mystery.

The first companion was [Ritter Stavanger](Ritter%20Stavanger%205e66780ca2cd4079b7bd6332b96764db.md), an Orc, seasoned and veteran Warrior and wilder of the sword.
The second was [Rain Domarien](Rain%20Domarien%2007405bcb8f704b999f3d71916797b863.md), a Gnomish wizard and wielder of the staff
The third was [Klerana Mavis](Klerana%20Mavis%206ebb99b9a7764456a01f7fd4dfa5cf8e.md), an Elven Cleric wielder of the crown.
The fourth [Milena Goldleaf](Milena%20Goldleaf%20a8fb20aa07314eafb1a906c1cb0a9e8b.md), a human necromancer and bard who wielded a magical violin but kept her identity a secret

**Beginning of the End**

On the island now known as Valkorian's Seat, the companions met to measure the results as they had conquered the entire continent and eliminated all opposition.  Bloodied and tired a large number of their troops rested on the islands as the companions met with Valkorian to discuss the next steps.

Milena Goldleaf was not happy with the evil that had been committed and had been secretly working with several groups to take down Valkorian, as he was no longer the well-mannered man that she knew from ages ago. He was also a very smart man and hard to dupe. Milena set multiple plans in motion just in case it did not go well. And she was right to do so, as he had traitors within her ranks that blew her cover.

The meeting on Valkorian's Seat was a ruse to get Milena to move here with her troops and Valkorian intended to purge them.
