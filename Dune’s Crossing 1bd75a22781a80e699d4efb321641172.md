Dune’s Cross is a town that was built at the mouth of the [Uralgatoa’s Dunes](Uralgatoa%E2%80%99s%20Dunes%201bd75a22781a80bd935ed1b9a20e95d5.md). There are several rails that end here and no rails go further into the dunes themselves. The crossing is a mercantile town built around explorers, treasure hunters and scholars who come to the Dunes to make discoveries study or get rich quick while risking their lives as mercenaries or bodyguards.
