### Summary

Kaito Lightbinder has been living his entire life in [Himoari](Himoari%20428d909dafc94e9d9293056ddd09ab51.md) alongside the [Hangetsu Clan](Hangetsu%20Clan%204f4cf2951eef4ce1ae0eb026c3b3ab4e.md). His house was situated out in the woods as he preferred to be mostly left alone.

He practiced the study of stars from this studio and was mostly treated as an eccentric. Unfortunately no other Pale Elves remained as his family died in a fire accident in 3207.

### **Relationships and History**

Having met [Astellios Lightseeker](Astellios%20Lightseeker%209df94ac6f30949a69dd6c024e821df50.md), the 2 Astromancers shared knowledge and together dived deeper into the Fox constellation, which was not fully understood or discovered by the Astromancers at [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md).

Using this as a precursor to do more, [Astellios Lightseeker](Astellios%20Lightseeker%209df94ac6f30949a69dd6c024e821df50.md) convinced [Kaito Lightbinder](Kaito%20Lightbinder%20812f152080844bc1a77f3a9bec5d9efc.md) to pack his things and go for a long journey around [Yamagato](Yamagato%2046d0fc8d09494cf095ac9d96213767c8.md) sharing the knowledge of Astromancy with as many people as possible.

This was a godsend for Kaito as it gave him a new purpose to find happiness in his life.
