The guard and army captain of Bellmark, is Tribune Steeljaw. This [Draconian](Draconian%20ad50140d703041b7ac34b0776a1f9722.md) got his name Steeljaw from an accident where his lower jaw was torn apart, he survived it and replaced his skin and jaw with a Steel contraption.
Towers over most men, he patrols the streets frequently and is loved by the people.
He comes from a long line of Dracconians that have served the empire. However, he inherited his fighting style from the [Jade Dragoons](Jade%20Dragoons%20ee59534d25c943beb6f38e9fc2769060.md) is back in the [Dragon Lands](Dragon%20Lands%20ce9140f993044a80964a1b2ba0eb025a.md) even though, he never visited himself.

Following the creation of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md), Marcus took up the mantle as one of the Councillors and took charge of the defense of the people. He formally joined the ranks of the [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md) as they were the official defense force for the new formed state.

### Appearance and Personality

He is a follower of [Iknos (God of Law)](Iknos%20(God%20of%20Law)%20ff4278878e3d4fcbb67d442139bee0aa.md) and respects people and the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) ‘s Law. While now a citizen of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md), his beliefs in sense of justice have not wavered and stills respects people for who they are and what they do more than where they are from.

### Skills, Abilities and Possessions

He owns a small dragonling pet that helps him send long-range messages. He fights with a large lance and is extremely quick on his feet, the Dragoon fighting style is rarely seen in the empire.

As the leader of the [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md) in [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) Marcus was also the owner of the warship called **‘Argent Spear’** 

### **Relationships and History**

He was involved in a large-scale operation to retrieve the Prince of the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md), which ended in success but later led to [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md)‘s people revolted and gained a sort of independence. 

He got to know the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) very well and accompanied them on the long journey (mostly because he did not trust the new blood). Being a good man, before being a soldier, he abandoned the mantle of the Empire and swore to protect the people. 

Marcus joined the Council of [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) to help bolster the soldiers and train them for the tough times to come. Thanks to his training the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md) made it out for he [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md) without stratospheric losses.

With the biggest contract ever for the [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md) being handled by [Marcus Steeljaw](Marcus%20Steeljaw%2085d3a81781fd4875b63130eac6d909ad.md), the previous leader **Mattheus The Bold**, gave the leadership of the [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md) to [Marcus Steeljaw](Marcus%20Steeljaw%2085d3a81781fd4875b63130eac6d909ad.md) and now his aide [Radegundh V Duskember](Radegundh%20V%20Duskember%20ac0c23e3ded6497fb008f10fc5232fbc.md). Both Rade and Marcus have now started building the Silver Eagles to be the defensive force of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md), for all the people regardless of how small their home or land.

This ended the story of the Silver Eagles as a large guild, but their recruitment methods still are vastly the same and unlike other armies. This goes hand in hand with how the City-States operate as a group of cities, and the acceptance of different people into their midst.
