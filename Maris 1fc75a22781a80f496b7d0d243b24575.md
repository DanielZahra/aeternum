[Maris](Maris%201fc75a22781a80f496b7d0d243b24575.md) is mentioned as the ‘most beautiful’ region of [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md). While this whole region is in the underground of Cerulia. The ‘roof’ here is completely transparent and the sea  depth above[Maris](Maris%201fc75a22781a80f496b7d0d243b24575.md) is much smaller than the rest of [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md) . The shallower sea and the mana around the sea water above and roof allows the light from the [**Celestial Aureole aka The Sun**](Celestial%20Aureole%20aka%20The%20Sun%2018e75a22781a80ac9803ec990c96261c.md) to be very visible, as such [Maris](Maris%201fc75a22781a80f496b7d0d243b24575.md) experiences the night and day cycle almost like those living on the surface, but of course as a much lesser degree. Looking at the ‘sky’ of [Maris](Maris%201fc75a22781a80f496b7d0d243b24575.md) one can observe all the vibrant sea life.
