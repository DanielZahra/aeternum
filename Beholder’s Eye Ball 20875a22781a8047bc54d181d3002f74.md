This Dwarven drink contains soft large lizard eyeballs which have a lot nutrients. They are mixed in with mead, honey and grape alcohol to make an exotic drink. These drinks are served in jars and called the [Beholder’s Eye Ball](Beholder%E2%80%99s%20Eye%20Ball%2020875a22781a8047bc54d181d3002f74.md) to make the drink even more ‘risky’ or exotic but their taste is quite mild. This drink does have a very high alcoholic content so, those who are not used to hard liquor will feel this.
