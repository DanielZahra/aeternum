# Heathens of the Soul

Tags: Knowledge

This is a book about creatures or people that have defied the rules set by the twelve and break the soul cycle.

The chapters of this book describe how specific creatures throughout history have broken the will of the gods and kept their souls, lives, or bodies for a longer period of time than the natural order permitted.

The writing in this book is heavy-handed and written by the Church of the Twelve. The subject matter is clearly labeled as sinners and evil in the eyes of the Twelve.

### Nosferatu

The book discusses creatures of the darkness known as the Nosferatu (or Vampires). These creatures, while they age and die normally, they have found a way to control their own souls. They can push their own soul out of their own body and as the soul moves through the Ethereal Plane and they can attempt to possess another person’s body by pushing out the person’s soul, essentially killing the person in the process, and body gets taken over and transforms into a Nosferatu.

### The Forgotten

These broken husks of dead people are stopping fragments of souls from moving to the ethereal plane. Their presence is a sacrilege to the Twelve and those that have the magic to make them are also considered heathens.

The book describes the rite of sending needed to get rid of the [Forgotten](Forgotten%2006e3b3ba9eb349538fd9eec617dc7e58.md).

### Liches

Liches are people that are extending their soul’s life at any cost. Most liches were powerful in life and learned the dark magic of necromancy to extend their own life.

A lich extends its life and soul by using a ritual to sacrifice and consume a living being. The lich’s body doesn’t extend beyond this and often they are depicted as mummified, skeletal, or zombified creatures.

The lich will often store these souls in a powerful orb of magic which gives them a source of immortality and power.
