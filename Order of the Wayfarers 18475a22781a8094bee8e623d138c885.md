**The Order of the Warfarers** 

The Order of the Wayfarers is a brotherhood of knights bound by a sacred duty to traverse the vast expanse of worlds and planes. Founded on the principles of discovery, unity, and guardianship, they embody a spirit of relentless perseverance and unshakable faith in the greater good. Each member carries with them the weight of their oaths, driven by the belief that no journey is too far, no challenge too great, when the fate of realms hangs in the balance.

The Wayfarers hold that knowledge and understanding lie beyond every horizon. They embrace the unknown, seeking wisdom in uncharted lands and forgotten realms. To stagnate is to falter; to journey is to grow.

### **The Wayfarer’s Oath**

Every knight of the Order swears the Wayfarer’s Oath upon their initiation:

*"I pledge myself to the endless path, to the winds that guide and the stars that light the way. I will wander where others dare not tread, carrying the hopes of the many to the farthest reaches. I will stand firm against the tide of chaos, a guardian of crossroads, a seeker of truth, and a harbinger of peace. With sword, shield, and heart unyielding, I shall fulfill my oath to the Order, to the worlds, and to the balance that binds them all."*
