The Uralgatoa Dunes is a desert in the [Umbra](Umbra%207f340c9a24ce450cb2d96e5fe3f424a1.md) region of Cerulia. The sand here has the hue of red and maroon. This underground deserts spans for many kilometres and is dotted with remains and ruins of a long abandoned [Aezatan](Aezatan%203da707b77610408784cd1bdfc44fe23f.md) metropolis. 

These dunes got their name from Uralgatoa which is the name given to the remains of a marine titan whose bones now span across the dunes. These impossibly large bones are said to give life to the desert and if the stories are to be believed, the sand’s red hue is due to the blood of the titan.

The area has a rather high temperature as the dunes are high on volcanic activity. A good number of [Cataclysmic Geysers](Cataclysmic%20Geysers%2017875a22781a803094edf6b83bc9039d.md) can be found within the dunes. These geysers and the hear cause this area to have erratic ‘weather’ and often there are heavy hot winds which cause sand storms.

Many treasure hunters and glory-hounds brave the dunes to explore the old ruins for a chance to strike it rich and make a discovery of a lifetime. A good number of those people do not make it back as the dunes are mostly considered a no-man’s land and are quite deadly to those not capable of defending themselves.

The closest civilisation to the dunes is [Dune’s Crossing](Dune%E2%80%99s%20Crossing%201bd75a22781a80e699d4efb321641172.md) which is situated exactly at the mouth of the desert and is where most people gather.

### Environment

This desert rests on a large volcanic area. The red send is mixed in ash and volcanic rock. This leaves the large cavern to be quite hot compared to the upper reaches of Umbra.
