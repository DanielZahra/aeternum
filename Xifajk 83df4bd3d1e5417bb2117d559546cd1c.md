### Summary

The Xifajks (Shi-Fa-e-yk) are a breed of fiends with ash grey to ebon black skin, and leathery wings that act as predators and hunt other creatures for sport but also to feed.

While they posses wings but they cannot flying for long periods of time. As they become more powerful their leather skin shapes around their body to resemble armor of sorts.

These fiends are highly intelligent but also lust for raw meat and enjoy sipping or drinking the blood of other creatures. Their iron guts allow them to consume other creatures without worries of getting sick.

As they grow in power, their proportions also change, sometimes the Lords are a towering 2 and a half meters tall measuring the same height as a [Jotun](Jotun%20854ab2adba3d4ce09e6d2109bb4651e5.md).

### Abilities

Their society values martial power and they are often found wielding weapons as their hunting tools. Their claws are still sharp enough to tear through the armor or flesh of other creatures.
