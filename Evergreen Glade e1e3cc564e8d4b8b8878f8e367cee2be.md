### Summary

Original home of the Ashen Elves. A large community of hunters, and druids. The massive area is now divided between the Fellintran Elves and the Ashen Elves and it has been so for many centuries.

Much of the old Evergreen Glade is lost as it never recovered from the fire. 

In **1514 NA** Disaster struct one night, after a long drought, the entirety of Evergreen Glade was lit on fire, and hundreds of thousands of Elves died that day, burnt alive or suffocating in their own homes. Only a lucky few survived.

The Evergreen Glade is spread over hundreds of kilometres.
