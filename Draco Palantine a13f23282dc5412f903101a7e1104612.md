### **Relationships and History**

During the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md), Draco was betrayed by some of his own organization as they revealed his location to the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md) which initiated a full assault to end the war and take his life. The [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) infiltrated the statue in the [Falls of Gohondar](Falls%20of%20Gohondar%20d07eb0543c1448ef9bb03ec5f4d22f3c.md) and managed to defeat the Draco, Gaia and Cirillo (his bodyguards) in the statue’s head chambers. This ultimately, spiraled into the end of the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md).
