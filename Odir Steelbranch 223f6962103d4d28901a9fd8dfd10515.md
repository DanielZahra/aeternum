### **Relationships and History**

Odir met the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) as Avnon wanted to know more about the [Children of Leven](Children%20of%20Leven%2030e9783ada974b4585cd6c5222c05939.md). They shared stories and agreed that someday they would visit the [Ark](Ark%20fd15bfbd32ae4130b70c39abc5acbd0a.md).

In the meantime, Odir was happy to offer his ship’s services to the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) against good payment. One trip took them to Gohondar’s Fall and the other to Valkorian’s Seat.

After the rebellion in [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md), Odir took another long job with the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md), this time, it was to take them to the treacherous seas of the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md).

Having his crew threatened by [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md) left Captain[Odir Steelbranch](Odir%20Steelbranch%20223f6962103d4d28901a9fd8dfd10515.md), with a bad taste in his mouth and decided that working with the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) was more trouble than it was worth. He escorted them home and remain in their good graces but didn’t take more work from them.
