### Summary

At the root of the [Shattered Throat Mountains](Shattered%20Throat%20Mountains%202f91888ab4bf4b0287b685b81e8c1004.md)  on the western side of Kas'velar, lies the quite village of Frosthler. A sanctuary for travelers to rest their weary bones, in the frozen wastes of the north. Defending from the tribal raids is a frequent event, those that are not hardy do make live many winters here. Those that do make it through the cold live, a hard but fair life.

The village was founded next to an almost magical-like piece of the sea, some of the shamans believed that deep beneath the land, an active volcano keeps the water from freezing. The people of this village can use their boats and fish all year long without fearing the ice cold waters that surround this area of the continent. Brave people that explored the bottom of the extremely cold water mention that the deeper you go the warmer it gets proving that the heat is coming from the land itself confirming that a natural or perhaps divine force keeps the village safe.

These unfreezing waters are probabaly why the first people settled here and formed a community instead of roaming around Kas'Velar like the other tribes hunting and scavenging for food.

Sometimes the village will get boats from Bhadir that bring it trade and goods from the west. However this is quite rare, but the people here live happily in a sheltered quaint life without external politics or interference.

### Geography

Located in the coldest parts of Runaria, the snow never melts and the temperatures during the night time can easily freeze any man if they don't have a warm fire. With sea to the west and mountains to the east, the village has a lot of resources at their disposal.

### Populace

The village survives the cold weather by boating and fishing as much as possible. Woodcutters have to keep a constant supply of dry wood to avoid cold night. The people live in relative harmony with each other and band together to defend the village. Money is not really important here as the villagers share and trade between themselves.
