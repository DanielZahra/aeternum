# Bushidō’

The one rule that has always been present between the clans in Yamagato is the (‘***Bushidō*** (武士道, "the way of the warrior")

- When problems arise, they are solved with honorable and planned combat.
- If a clan decides to break these rules they can expect retribution from several other clans. This fear is what has kept ***Bushidō*** way working for thousands of years.
- This of course doesn’t stop some clans from trying to break the rules but in general, most clans stick to the Way of the Warrior.
