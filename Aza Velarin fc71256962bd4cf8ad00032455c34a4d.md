### Summary

An urchin from Bellmark's landing, trying to get by in the ditch was difficult so pickpocketing people was a good way to at least get some change and buy food.

Eventually, she stole from the wrong person and found her way by working with and for the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md).She spent most of her time with [Violet Whisper](Violet%20Whisper%204ba99116523d4acd92f6865b5d4c148d.md) as they were best friends. She was working her way to earn enough money to join the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md) when she switched sides and joined the [Copper Rats](Copper%20Rats%2080dc3a7e773e4b7f97ceadc9f93ace8c.md) earning her a bounty on her head.

### Appearance and Personality

A bit of a scatterbrained person but her acrobatics and contortion skills are crazy good.

She has a good heart but petty theft is the only thing she learnt growing up alone in this city.

She has been punished more times than she can count but has grown up to know how to avoid problems now.

### **Relationships and History**

She met and worked with the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) on multiple occasions but was never too friendly with them.

Seeing how the Syndicate conducted business she betrayed them and joined the [Copper Rats](Copper%20Rats%2080dc3a7e773e4b7f97ceadc9f93ace8c.md) which earned her a bounty of her head.

During the rebellion of [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md), somebody collected on the bounty as Aza was found dead in the streets with an arrow stuck in the back of her head.
