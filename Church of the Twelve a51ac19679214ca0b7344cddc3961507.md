# Church of the Twelve

Tags: Fellintra, Universal

The Church of the Twelve is the biggest and most sacrosant organisation that follows the teachers the words of the twelve.

## Dogmas of the Church

- The Church mostly follows a straightforward dogma and tries to teach the faith and do good in the world. People are free to worship the twelve almost how they want, this varies very differently per region.

### Revival Magic

Where the Church is involved, revival magic or alchemy are mostly forbidden, as they mess with the natural order of the [Soul Cycle](Soul%20Cycle%200b4eb2074d3041e59ed87f2c03f731df.md). Very rarely, good things come out of powers that mess around with the natural order of life and death. That that dabble in the business of [Soul Stone](https://www.notion.so/Soul-Stone-1f170e38907e4810b76bdb5bf759046e?pvs=21)s do so at the risk of angering the Church.

## Immortality and Undead

Alongside the revival of the dead, the church of the twelve teaches that immortality is reserved only for the gods. Those that strove to try to live forever are considered heretics and will be hunted by the [Order of the Justiciars](Order%20of%20the%20Justiciars%20e81167f89f5c46ceb05b658d78d00ee0.md). 

This often also includes the undead, as these creatures are seen as an abomination in the eyes of the church. Some spirits and eathereal beings are considered natural and the church leaves them be.

## The Order

The Holy Knights of the Twelve are also known as 'The Order' are the biggest army representing the [The Twelve (Gods)](The%20Twelve%20(Gods)%207e8a666a7f414fde89581346a9da8da2.md) and also enforcers when Religion is threatened. Their ideals and methods are borderline fanatical and when they go on a crusade, it will take a miracle to change their ways. The headquarters of the Order is in the [Holy City of Lancewood](Holy%20City%20of%20Lancewood%204021f6651edd4e4aba71cb199a8f984c.md).
