# Civic Knuckle

Level: 18
Section: Underforge
Select: Tavern

This bar turned into a small arena is where people have been meeting, drinking and placing bets on ‘civil’ pugilistic fights. The fights here have a referee who makes sure there is no foul play, no lethality, no weapons, no heavy armor and mainly stick to close quarter combat within a 3x3 meter ring. While this is strictly not legal it is also, not illegal.

Behind the counter one can find [Grimshtod Bing](Grimshtod%20Bing%2020875a22781a80769344e7004339217b.md) serving hard liquor and cheap ale.
