### Summary

Founded shortly after the end of the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md) circa 2670 NA, Stellaria started as an observatory built with non-official Lycian funding on top of the highest mountains in the [Malneau Mountains](Malneau%20Mountains%209ec4142f1fea495ea495acc7a5046570.md) on the Lycian side of the Lycia-Palantine Empire border. The first group of [Pale Elf](Pale%20Elf%20f2b604f694fe4bd2a9e78480a2b535e0.md) that settled here had freed themselves from the compulsion that bound them (with the aid of the united armies of Valkoria) and decided to stay in Runaria. Favoring the Lycian ideals of knowledge and the arcane, they were closer to Lycia and, with their patronage, they built the observatory and called it Stellaria.

In time, Stellaria grew to house more than just an observatory (now called the Observatorium), as a town grew around the area. While Stellarian teaching is not officially part of Lycian Academics, they do have an academy (the Academiae and the Observatorium itself) that teaches astromancy and knowledge of the stars, which the Pale Elves were already quite familiar with from their space travels in the psionic war. The original purpose of the Observatorium was to seek the fabled home of the Pale Elves before their enslavement, at this point it's a little more of a legend that they came from a  world called Astralia or so it is believed, while also continuing studying the stars and share the knowledge with their Lycian patrons.

Stellaria has since become a decently well-known center of astronomy and astromancy in Valkoria, though this scholarly area is still fairly unknown to most. However, scholars from Lycia and even other continents and worlds have visited Stellaria on occasion, which has helped to build their chronicles of knowledge that they keep in the Bibliotheca.

In the last few years, as Stellaria has become more well-known and generations have passed, a number of younger students have begun to question why they should seek a fabled world that may not even exist anymore when they have everything they need right here in Runaria. They have started a great debate on Lycian Unification, with the intent of growing Stellaria’s hub of knowledge and proving their worth to Lycia to be considered worthy of becoming part of Lycia officially, and perhaps even gain the official credentials as a seat of study within Lycia. Many older generations oppose Lycian Unification, but the main proponent of this, Vasilios Starcaller, has gained more support from younger elves in recent years.

The discussion about the Unification ended during the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md) where [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md) officially joined [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md) to get protection from the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md).

As time went by, more outsiders moved in and some of the original families left to explore. The people of Valkoria brought in new ideas, magic and resources, and the community is now still striving as a place of learning and a home. The Astral Elven dream of returning home is still a dream of some but the newer generation call Aeternum their home. This doesn't stop some of the ambitious younglings from still dreaming of exploring the stars like their grandfathers used to.

### Lifestyle

A portion of the population here, especially the researchers mostly live and work at night when the stars are out. The village is built around this, of course, they still need people to bring them food, till the fields, and travel up and down the mountain to keep it safe. The place is growing and with the Lycian unification being discussed, more people from Lycia are visiting and putting pressure on the families.

Of course with the city being on the border, there is a number of visitors from the Empire that are curious about the teachings here and also sometimes more politically driven individuals meet with members of the families.

### History

The founding of Stellaria was far from easy. The [Pale Elf](Pale%20Elf%20f2b604f694fe4bd2a9e78480a2b535e0.md) community that got together to build themselves a home were alien to their surrounding and there was a deep hated for their kind. The hatred stemmed from the fact that most of them fought for the [Psionic](Psionic%208302f0efd60244b1be7a22191f32ac32.md)s in the war (most gloss over the fact that they didn’t have a choice). It was only in the latter parts of the ‣ the [Pale Elf](Pale%20Elf%20f2b604f694fe4bd2a9e78480a2b535e0.md) control was broken and they switched sides.

Shortly after the continent of [Valkoria](Valkoria%2063188c93864440e591a3528e50868ec6.md)n continent was in the middle of disagreements and in disarray. The early founders of Lycia, were interested in the magic brought to Aeternum and they helped the small community with some funding. However, this was very minor in the beginning. [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md) was in its first years too, so they focused on their own growth.

Over many generations and a few centuries [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md) went mostly unnoticed and ignored as the little tribe was tiny and they did not communicate much with the outside world. The more generations passed, the more the people of Stellaria ventured out into the world. It took the [Pale Elf](Pale%20Elf%20f2b604f694fe4bd2a9e78480a2b535e0.md) centuries to ‘adapt’ to a new world and this slowed down their development as a community and a town.  Their studies caught the eye of the people interested in the stars.

[Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md) was lucky enough to avoid most of the havoc from the Valkorian wars as they were not a realistic not worthwhile target for the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) or the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md). In recent years as the little tribe flourished in a large community and talks of a full unification with [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md). The importance of Stellaria is on the increase and its location is almost seen as a strategic stop between the Empire and Lycia, especially that now the [Malneau Mountains](Malneau%20Mountains%209ec4142f1fea495ea495acc7a5046570.md) have proper roads that lead to the town.

### Unification

Unfortunately, shortly before the [End of the Sixth Valkorian War](End%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%20baaa265f20174631be11e4821e2552ba.md), a large battle took place at the gates of [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md), where a large contingent of troops form the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) were ready to invade. [Maev Rex](Maev%20Rex%2025a28a4d34b9431bbcd0de9e8fa22817.md) negotiated an alliance and [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md) joined [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md) officially and was no longer independent. They allows the Lycian troops to fight the Empire openly and defend [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md). During this conflict, the Vermillion Ritual took place which ended with the decimation of both armies. Which paused the war for a few weeks.

- With the unification formalized, Astromancy became an accepted way of study and magic within the colleges of Spirit within all of [Lycia](Lycia%20402bf15c994f402cbbf4ef7250df6463.md).
- The People of [Stellaria](Stellaria%20f6088af7dce147c4aa46a6e35340ae67.md) were now recognized as Lycians and offered the same rights as all Lycians.
- All Stellarians were to undergo magical examinations and gain new positions to fit within the Lycian structure.
