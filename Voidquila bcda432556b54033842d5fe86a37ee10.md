Tags: Tenebrium

One of, if the the most common hard drink in [Tenebrium (Plane of Darkness)](Tenebrium%20(Plane%20of%20Darkness)%207718024e47414800b2c2b6077c344e7d.md). This is made from the Black Agave plants which grow in dark recesses all over the plane of darkness.

When pourd for itâ€™s gourds, it flows in a metal-black color and is transluscent enough to see you darkened fingers as you gold a glass of it in your hands.

For most people, this rancid taste is almost unbreable and not good on the stomach. 

For non Fiends, gives [Dull Senses](https://www.notion.so/Dull-Senses-7a039b7a05ec4a46ab266624a250a627?pvs=21) for 1 hour if you fail a DC 15 [Toughness Saving Throw](https://www.notion.so/Toughness-Saving-Throw-a22c2193d81241b2b2e200be1ab3ddc6?pvs=21).
