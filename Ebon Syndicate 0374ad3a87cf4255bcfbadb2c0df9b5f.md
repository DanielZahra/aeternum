# Ebon Syndicate

Tags: Palantine Empire

A group of people hunters, thieves and assassins, bounty hunters. The Syndicate is known to be organized crime and they will often use people outside of their org to do their bidding.

Known to be in politically involved in most of [Valkoria](Valkoria%2063188c93864440e591a3528e50868ec6.md) the Syndicate is dangerous and will go to any length to protect their business. Their greed is what drives them and this usually means they are not the most trustworthy people. 

Their usual jobs are drug deals, theft, protection money, murder, money laundering and tax evasion.

### History

During the [End of the Sixth Valkorian War](End%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%20baaa265f20174631be11e4821e2552ba.md), [Boris Blackmantle](Boris%20Blackmantle%20f8d522d93e3446c8929afd9b5dea421b.md) and a group of syndicate members, ran a coup and took over the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md), at the same time a masterful heist was executed the it brought them a veritable mountain of gold. With the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md) freshly founded and post of a war, that gold was used as a very large leverage to get the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md) established as a powerful shadow network within the newly founded region in [Valkoria](Valkoria%2063188c93864440e591a3528e50868ec6.md).

This would usher the [Ebon Syndicate](Ebon%20Syndicate%200374ad3a87cf4255bcfbadb2c0df9b5f.md) in a now and hopefully more profitable path.
