### Leadership

[Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md) is lead as a community, and nobody rules over the rest. The Grove however has taken to mostly listen to the the Wardens as the main source of knowledge and know-how since they usually will have more worldly experience than the rest of the people. The current wardens are [Garrant](Garrant%2012675a22781a807f99dafeee9925d29f.md) and [Roweena](Roweena%2012675a22781a808f8e0adc412c44b8ca.md) who protect [Selenna](Selenna%2012675a22781a80b59af9fe7de88b8c3b.md) the [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md).

    The Wolven Tree is found in the dead center of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md) Grove. As the tree grows, its bark and leaves are always curated, and carved to resemble the face of a Wolf and its Mane. Most events, feasts and meeting of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md) are usually held at the base of the Wolven Tree.
    
- [Fangroot](Fangroot%2012675a22781a80fea1c9ce4d74ef38d3.md)
    
    
    This modest building is a place of work, alchemy, herbalism, and magic. All those versed in the above work here to ensure the safety and healthy living of the grove. Each section of this treehouse has its uses and goals. It’s placed in its secluded area due to the nature of the experiments and sometimes sicknesses that visit the place. 
    
- [Lupakku’s Claw](Lupakku%E2%80%99s%20Claw%2012675a22781a80a78ccfc343d56a51de.md)
    
    
    The Claw is where those that shape the objects crafted within the mesa find their tools, work, and livelihoods. Weapons, Gear, Furniture, Carts, Ropes. Whatever the Covenant needs the Claw makes. 
    
    The Claw is dug into the mesa surface and built as a cave with chimneys. The heat of the forges here is not well suited for treehouses.
    
    Within the backside of the Claw, further beneath the surface and roots, there is a Burrow network for storage used by the people of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md).

This Chapel is dedicated to [Ravana (Goddess of War)](Ravana%20(Goddess%20of%20War)%20ef885dcf2dac40bd934703daa3d8b6aa.md) and [Foristra (Goddess of Nature)](Foristra%20(Goddess%20of%20Nature)%20228c4ae2b832446cbf62058bf1fbcb16.md). It is built within the trunk of one the large trees and the interior is decorated with animal furs, bones and trophies that were acquired by the people of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md). Most of the people from the [Covenant of the Wolf](Covenant%20of%20the%20Wolf%2012575a22781a80d99e01f30949cd5c3f.md) will spend some hours here once a week to revere the gods and relax their minds.
    
- [The Den](The%20Den%2012675a22781a80a596c8ecd59225cd95.md)
    
    
    The Den is the [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md)’s home. It’s a spiritual place and scared to the people of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md). While the Den is open for everyone there are multiple areas of the cavern where only the Elder Wardens and [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md)s are allowed. When a new [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) is born, they do not leave [The Den](The%20Den%2012675a22781a80a596c8ecd59225cd95.md) for at least a year, where they are thought and trained by the current [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md). Protecting the Den is the main job of the Elder Wardens.
    
- [Lupakku Lakes](Lupakku%20Lakes%2012675a22781a805ebfe8c52fefb40553.md)
    
    
    The Lake is a large body of water that is the main source of life for everything on the [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md) Mesa. The [Covenant of the Wolf](Covenant%20of%20the%20Wolf%2012575a22781a80d99e01f30949cd5c3f.md) make it their own responsibility that this lake is pristine and provides clean water to drink for the Grove. The lake is close enough to the grove and is a safe enough walk for even the youngest of the people. 
    
    Often everyone refers to the Eastern lake as Lupakku lake but there are also 2 minor lakes to the west of the Mesa, which are just called the western lakes.
    
- [The Burrows](The%20Burrows%2012975a22781a805a8071cbb15331cfb6.md)

Members of the [Lupakku’s Claw](Lupakku%E2%80%99s%20Claw%2012675a22781a80a78ccfc343d56a51de.md) are responsible for maintaining and expanding the Burrows around the mesa. While digging new burrows these miners are using several alchemical compounds and tools, while also finding precious rocks and ore that rests within the mesa itself.

    Known as the Wolf Way, this is a long-winded, path that travels around the outer area of the Mesa and allows foot ftraffic to travel from the top of the mesa, to the floor of [Mistvale](Mistvale%2012475a22781a808a86d7ea4e1bdc406a.md). The journey is long and tiresome and not always safe. The way itself is not patrolled or particularly well maintained. 
    
- [Mz’Lupakku Menagerie](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%20Menagerie%2013375a22781a8080a739fcaaf7ddc8f4.md)
    
    
    As with many other places in [Fellintra](Fellintra%208a284461caa445f9a1c30e2b1477f45e.md) the people of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md) also have blended the fauna of the land around them and trained animals and beasts to do their bidding.

- [Fane of the First Wolf](Fane%20of%20the%20First%20Wolf%2012e75a22781a802fa04beb2cdf05d9a1.md) : Only Wardens and Spirit guardians know that this place is still accessible and it is used as a testing ground for new wardens and their spirit guardian charge.

## History

The First Wolf’s name was lost but the people refer to the Spirit Guardian ancestor as Kannon, and ever since them Mz’Lupakku has always had one or more Spirit Guardians to take care of its people along side a group of Wardens.

### Current Leadership

The current leadership of Mz’Lukappu had a successful  Searing but it has been bloody, 2 out of the 4 wardens that left on the journey did not return. Mlikki, died early on in the journey as she succumbed to the [Mist Plague](https://www.notion.so/Mist-Plague-12675a22781a808fa847f212f7cba311?pvs=21) and Rokku, sacrificed himself against a large group of [Mist Reavers](Mist%20Reavers%2012675a22781a804688afeb5bf58646da.md)  to save [Selenna](Selenna%2012675a22781a80b59af9fe7de88b8c3b.md), [Garrant](Garrant%2012675a22781a807f99dafeee9925d29f.md) and [Roweena](Roweena%2012675a22781a808f8e0adc412c44b8ca.md). 

### The Searing 3195 NA

In the year 3195 NA a group of wardens and their spirit guardian left on the searing, unfortunately, the last Wardens and their [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) have been lost and there is a hint of panic within the Grove of late. 

### The Searing 3215 NA

However things have taken a brighter note now that a new [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) ([Rikke](Rikke%2012675a22781a80cb873bf31799672d1f.md)) has been chosen and has been in training for a year and a new group of Wardens have been ready to make the Searing.
