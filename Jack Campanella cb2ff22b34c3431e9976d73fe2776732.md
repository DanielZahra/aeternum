### Summary

A young man from the poor people of [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md).  Sick of the Fighting caused by the **[Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md).** The people fund the wars by paying taxes and then they die for lofty ideals of some richer folk.

He is one of the leaders of the [Copper Rats](Copper%20Rats%2080dc3a7e773e4b7f97ceadc9f93ace8c.md). Or at least seems to be on.

His goal was to set [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) free of the Empire. And started planning a revolt.

He wants the people to govern themselves, not some senate that is hundreds of miles away.

### Appearance and Personality

Red Haired, torn clothing, tattoos, ropes, gear. Cuts and bruises. He appears to be your typical cutpurse or street rat. However, he exudes an aura of authority and command.

### **Relationships and History**

He disrupted the Execution of [Cameron Mavis](Cameron%20Mavis%205658a635029e430cb235619939f851eb.md), this action launched [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) into a revolt. He managed to convince the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) to aid in the rebellion and not side with the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md). This series of events caused the Empire to lose control of [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) which slowly spiralled into the [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md).

[Jack Campanella ](Jack%20Campanella%20cb2ff22b34c3431e9976d73fe2776732.md) still quietly leads the [Copper Rats](Copper%20Rats%2080dc3a7e773e4b7f97ceadc9f93ace8c.md), but they are now a much more peaceful organization and left their thieving behind to help out the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md). They are building themselves a new home in Copper Alley from the ashes of ‘Little Messana’ in [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md).
