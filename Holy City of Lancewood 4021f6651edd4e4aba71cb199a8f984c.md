### Summary

The Holy City of Lancewood is known as the holy city as within the material plane, the religious leaders all congregate here. An impossibly huge Stone lance is embedded in the surface of Fellintra, this is known as the Lance of Ravana. A relic of the gods within the worlds. The lance itself pierces the clouds in the sky and stands out in the landscape. It can be seen from many miles away and precious few know what it is at the top.

Around the Lance, is the largest tree in all of Fellintra known as the mother tree. It is said that the mother tree is the mother all of all life on Fellintra. The tree has grown around the lance and the city has grown within and around the tree itself.

The area around the tree hosts a massive lake of fresh water that probably filled the crater that was created when the lance hit Fellintra.
