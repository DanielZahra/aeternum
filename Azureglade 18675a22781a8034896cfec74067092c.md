### Summary

[Azureglade](Azureglade%2018675a22781a8034896cfec74067092c.md) started out as a smaller glade for druidic people to congregate and live in harmoy with the [Cobalt Forest](Cobalt%20Forest%2018675a22781a804ebf16d0524faa6b2f.md) but over time a small village formed around them and everyone here respects the order of nature and follows the Azure Sage’s wisdom. The village is built under a marvel of a scene. The ‘roof’ here is a very thick, transparent crystalline material. It allows some light to traverse from the oceans above, the transparency is enough to allow the people to see the sea above them. For most underground Ceruleans, this probably makes them somewhat uncomfortable but the people here nurture this feeling of closeness to nature. 

The village is built from and within the boughs of the [Cobalt Forest](Cobalt%20Forest%2018675a22781a804ebf16d0524faa6b2f.md). A good number of people also practice druidic rites and most will at least manage the simplest of natural cantrips. The more skilled druids here have learned to shape their forms into the crystalline roof and move through it to be able to swim, hunt and explore the ocean above. Albeit the ocean depths are a rather dangerous place for the uninitiated.

The Glade’s Source is a river that passes through the edge of the village and provides a good source of water for drinking and growing crops.

### Tradition

The Druids of [Azureglade](Azureglade%2018675a22781a8034896cfec74067092c.md) routinely performed a calming ritual in the [Cobalt Forest](Cobalt%20Forest%2018675a22781a804ebf16d0524faa6b2f.md), this ritual allows their village to coexist with the forest and reduce the ‘danger’ of the area.

## Events

### Troubles in the Cobalt Forest

In the year 3202, a Tribe of Dragonspawn has arrived in Azurelgade seeking refuge after they had left their homeland in the Dragon lands. Within the first 2 the Dragonspawn could not adapt to the way of life of the people from Azureglade as respect from both communities was not achieved. [Gazzna Bramblenock](Gazzna%20Bramblenock%201ac75a22781a80bdb802c4d4b9894cab.md) as the Azure Sage has provided the Dragonspawn community a ‘Home’ in the north of the [Cobalt Forest](Cobalt%20Forest%2018675a22781a804ebf16d0524faa6b2f.md), a long abandoned citadel owned by the Blackfist Smithing Company. In the year 3215 NA, the Cobalt Forest was becoming extremely dangerous and the rituals of the Druids were ending in complete disaster. After multiple of the senior druid had died to the ritual. [Gazzna Bramblenock](Gazzna%20Bramblenock%201ac75a22781a80bdb802c4d4b9894cab.md) worked with a group of adventurers who happened to be in the area. She sent them to the Citadel to retrieve her brother [**Fendall Bramblenock**](Fendall%20Bramblenock%201c875a22781a80538b0bef554c540533.md) who had left to live with the Dragonspawn as she suspected that he had a hand in the issue with the forest.  The adventuring party discovered that the Dragonspawn were now being led by [Karfixia](Karfixia%201c875a22781a80d0bc68d406cd1738fd.md) a [High Draconian](High%20Draconian%2083942692fba74247bf1e53cc21847ffa.md) and they also had a [Hayat Tree](Hayat%20Tree%201cc75a22781a80d68920fca3e9f958d8.md) controlled by [**Fendall Bramblenock**](Fendall%20Bramblenock%201c875a22781a80538b0bef554c540533.md).  A truce could not be achieved and the adventurers had to use force to stop the damage to the forest. [Karfixia](Karfixia%201c875a22781a80d0bc68d406cd1738fd.md) was killed in a battle, the Hayat Tree destroyed and [Fendall](https://www.notion.so/Fendall-1c875a22781a80dabba5f44881e2d4cf?pvs=21) taken back to [Azureglade](Azureglade%2018675a22781a8034896cfec74067092c.md).
