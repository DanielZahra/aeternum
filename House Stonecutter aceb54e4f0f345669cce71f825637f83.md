# House Stonecutter

Tags: Queendom of Nya'Tallin

An old family that worked and owned a lot of mines. The last surviving member, Fredrick spent a lot of their money and made lots of bad deals. They still hold some power but it slowly needs to be rebuilt.

They operated out of the Queendom of Nya'Tallin and their original home ground is north of the Capital [Isyen Lenora](Isyen%20Lenora%2025a3a780df3043f187093c732b6f279d.md)  and close to the [Western Valkorian Mountains](Western%20Valkorian%20Mountains%20316724fac01f45dca3fd6037705cdf38.md).
