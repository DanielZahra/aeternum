### Summary

Solera was a relatively unique Seraphim who travelled to [Umbra](Umbra%207f340c9a24ce450cb2d96e5fe3f424a1.md) and remained there for a very long time sharing the word and light of [Solas (God of Light)](Solas%20(God%20of%20Light)%20015540f7a3384a6183587703a171a5f7.md).

The people of [Umbra](Umbra%207f340c9a24ce450cb2d96e5fe3f424a1.md) were used to living in the underground and didn’t heed much the word of the god of light. However [Saint Solera](Saint%20Solera%2018775a22781a80d685ede82ab3a82f42.md) had aquired [Solera’s Bloom](Solera%E2%80%99s%20Bloom%2018775a22781a80108cabc353282f3993.md), a powerful artifact that allowed her to create a minor star from the **Celestial Aureole within the underground of Cerulia.**

### Death

Unftunately after Solera’s passing [Solera’s Bloom](Solera%E2%80%99s%20Bloom%2018775a22781a80108cabc353282f3993.md) was lost for many ages until the year 3210 whee a group from the [Order of the Wayfarers](Order%20of%20the%20Wayfarers%2018475a22781a8094bee8e623d138c885.md) managed to track the relic down. However, they found that when returned to [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) the relic was not what it once was.
