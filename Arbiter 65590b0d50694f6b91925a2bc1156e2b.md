# Arbiter

Playable: NPC Only

Arbiters come from the [J**udicium (**Plane of Law)](Judicium%20(Plane%20of%20Law)%2046f3842e3c1c42628e25965fffd97b07.md).

The Arbiters are cosmic beings almost without emotions, where logic reigns supreme. They see themselves as perfect and believe that as long as everything is orderly, the planes will stay forever. There are not many of them and they would rarely even consider leaving [J**udicium (**Plane of Law)](Judicium%20(Plane%20of%20Law)%2046f3842e3c1c42628e25965fffd97b07.md). Their main goal in life is progress and self-improvement.

They strive to create constructs and humanoids that 'function' in the best way possible. The main creation and most common Construct/Humanoid ware the [Forgeborn](Forgeborn%20bc063bad27a6430d94a7bda0638c9f4b.md) who form the main population of the [J**udicium (**Plane of Law)](Judicium%20(Plane%20of%20Law)%2046f3842e3c1c42628e25965fffd97b07.md) and its armies.
