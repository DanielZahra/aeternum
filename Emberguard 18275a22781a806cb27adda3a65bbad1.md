Tags: Cerulia, Emberdeep

The protectors of [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) are called the Emberguard and they only respond to the Emberlord. While their job is to protect the city’s people, more often than not their eyes are set on the mid and upper parts of the city and the lower levels are often left a bit on their own which makes them sometimes lawless. This hasn’t stopped the Emberguard from purging the lower levels every now and then as a show of force. The Emberguard is split into 3 factions or groups, the Goldguard, the Silverguard and the Copperguard, this reflected in their uniform and equipment.

The Goldguard are the protector of the rich and elite an mainly operate in the upper area of the city. 

The Silverguard are in charge of the largest central part of the city.

The Copperguard are the group of the Emberguard that is in charge on keeping a relatvie peace in the bottom area of Emberdeep. It is said that a good number of the Copperguard are more enforcers or ex-criminals than upstanding citizens.
