### Summary

Born in [Kas’Velar](Kas%E2%80%99Velar%20476c9e227f2443eca550f0ab8be45af5.md) where an accident killed her family. She ran away from home and somehow managed to stow away on a ship that got he to [Bhadir](Bhadir%20eecd93006c3f41b2823d389bf90cf286.md) where she learnt their ways, and language and got in a lot of trouble. 

Eventually, she met [Shi-rai Igarashi](Shi-rai%20Igarashi%202b00fac466024354b0273317d2e43ca0.md) joined the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) as protector and a Novice in the order.

She owes a great debt to the king of Bhadir, [Lothar Blackmane](Lothar%20Blackmane%20e9bd2bdf6bc240f59e074d86b5e4bf4d.md), as he saved her from execution, she will never forget this and eventually, she wants to repay him, somehow.

### Appearance and Personality

White fur with block pockmark dots and dark-maned hair. Shorter than most of her kind. Piercing blue eyes. Under the fur and hooded leather lies the athletic build of someone that has been active their whole life.

Flake acts cool, and calm with a snarky tongue, until a fight breaks out and she fights like a mad woman.

### Skills, Abilities and Possessions

Born in the savage continent of [Kas’Velar](Kas%E2%80%99Velar%20476c9e227f2443eca550f0ab8be45af5.md) and spent a long time in the streets of [Bhadir](Bhadir%20eecd93006c3f41b2823d389bf90cf286.md) has made Flake a strong tough and strong fighter. She doesn’t rely much on weapons as her claws are all she needs.

### **Relationships and History**

As she followed [Shi-rai Igarashi](Shi-rai%20Igarashi%202b00fac466024354b0273317d2e43ca0.md), she now took a job of protecting the new base of the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) in Bellmark’s Landing.
