The [Umbral Searing Sea](Umbral%20Searing%20Sea%2018675a22781a806aa076f72afe9303b8.md) is at the end of the [Flaxen Canyon](Flaxen%20Canyon%2018675a22781a80b28e4defc95aedcd92.md). The sea bed here is resting on top of plenty of magma, as such the salty sea water is very hot. People use it as a hot spring. While swimming is very possible not everyone can take the ‘heat’ so to speak. The sea itself is teeming with life and is the people here used the sea to create or ‘farm’ salt and cart it all over [Umbra](Umbra%207f340c9a24ce450cb2d96e5fe3f424a1.md).
