### Summary

Built in 2714 NA, this royal College and Academy in Nya'Tallin are considered to be one if not the best college for learning and teaching arts in the material planes. The vast majority of the students here are royals, nobles or extremely rich people.

The College comes with dormitories, butlers and serfs for each student enrolled in any kind of study here. The students pursue, magic, art, drama, music, writing, socializing and everything in between.

Of course, the college has very strict entrance requirements, apart from the large sums of gold required. Most commoners are not welcome, this is derived mostly from the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md)  Political Monarchy and class system.

The college itself was sponsored by the first Queen of Nya'Tallin as a place to send her children to learn and develop their high-soceity skills. To this day, the royal children will all attend the college and are treated as the preferred students.
