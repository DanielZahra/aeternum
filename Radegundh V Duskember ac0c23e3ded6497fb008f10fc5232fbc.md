### Summary

Radegundh was born on 3190 NA, an Ashen Elf, to a loving mother (Merovin; maiden surname Verdurerni. father ([Klotan V Duskember](Klotan%20V%20Duskember%2099cdd29b24f847adb6a08e08f487b1d3.md) ; ), and an older sister (Marika; 6 years older). And Deron (10 years older) Born with pale skin and white hair as is the norm of those of their race. Slightly above average height. His family, who are a bit well off, resided in Vakkengard, a small village in [Valkoria](Valkoria%2063188c93864440e591a3528e50868ec6.md) , known also as Titan's Rest as it is nestled between a colossal rib cage of a long-dead Titan of ancient, legendary times. Several other remains can be found around the village and within the soil - which is known to be extremely fertile, believed to be due to the Titanic remains in the earth. This has also made the village into a sort of touristic / pilgrimage spot - people interested in history, titans, or just looking for general wonderment and pilgrims - Titanborn and otherwise - that are visiting different titanic remains in the world(s).

His mother, Merovin, took care of the family, and a small patch of farm and a few farm animals that they own. In her spare time, she would play the goat horn (bukkehorn), which Radegundh particularly enjoyed from his very first days. She also taught him the basics of how to play until her early death. Merovin developed a sickness when Radegundh was 6, and she started becoming weaker and weaker at an alarming rate. Klotan searched for doctors or people of faith that could heal her, but unfortunately, such people were not easy to come by. He did bring a few back to Vakkengard from Bellmark's Landing, but they could not treat her, all the while the disease was progressing fast. Radegundh and Marika desperately prayed to the Twelve for their mother to recover or to find a doctor or cleric who could help her, but no such aid came - neither from mortal nor god - and she withered away and died in the span of 3 months (age 38). This devastated the remaining members of the family. From this side of the family, he has one Aunt (Doravia Edrefrond), who lives at another Ashen Elf settlement not too far away with her husband (Thuval Edrefrond), and two daughters.

His father, Klotan, was, and still is, mainly a book trader and collector (inherited from his father who inherited from his father and so on - the Duskember collection), and every so often travels, mostly to and from Bellmark's Landing and later on to Stellaria when specific books concerning constellations and their readings were in his possession, to buy and sell books; ideally buying at low prices and selling at higher. Some books he keeps to add to the family collection - a small library in their residence; a makeshift book shop on rare occasions. Klotan is also an accomplished fighter with a greatsword, fighting to be an important skill to possess - to be able to defend yourself when needed during travels, especially if carrying precious books or some modest amount of gold. This is a skill that he passed on to his children. Deron, helped around the shop and being the elder brother he was planning to inherit the business at some point.

He also teaches the village's children how to read, and write, as well as some history, and other subjects - using certain books from his collection. The peoples of the village, who are mostly also Ashen Elves, are appreciative of this and donate money as recompense. When not doing book trading, teaching or practising swordsmanship he helps out with the small farm and house chores. The loss of his wife when his children were 6(Radegundh) and 12 (Marika) affected him a lot and he became more dedicated to his work and lessons, while still being a good father.

Klotan had instilled a sense of wonder, and a love of history and knowledge, in both of his children - he had fond memories of them listening to him wide-eyed while he recounted tales of the world, especially of Titanborn  and their devotion to their ancestors, as well as of their legendary titanic origins - the remains of which were a background, that never lost its magnificence, to their daily lives. This interest was nourished more especially after Radegundh was diagnosed with Soul Dreaming ([Soul Cycle](Soul%20Cycle%200b4eb2074d3041e59ed87f2c03f731df.md)). Klotan also recited the story of the Ashen Elves or Shadar-kai in Fellintran, their otherwordly origin, the long drought, the following burning death and flawed divine revival, the significance of their skin and hair colour, the wars over perceived slightness done to a goddess which had not cared to lend aid in dire times, the great journey by their ancestors, and eventual settlement all over Runaria and the consequent events that unfolded - such as the psionic war and the great losses experienced by all in this village, as well as the worlds in general.

This instilled into Radegundh a dislike of most of the Twelve from an early age; "Why didn't Foristra quell the fires or call upon guardians of nature to act on her behalf? Was a lush and cardinal forest such as the [Burning of the Evergreen Glade](Burning%20of%20the%20Evergreen%20Glade%20284441c1fc7349faa62086ce42bf4575.md)  of no importance to the gods? Why did Graav raise them with a permanent mark? Why rouse all the hatred and civil war? Was Ravana in on this? Are they playing with our lives? Why did the divine raise no finger against invaders from the Far Planes? Are there other deities? Better ones?"

Radegundh became disillusioned with the gods more and more over the years, with the only exception being Duztar, God of Creation. He gained a healthy appreciation for the arts from his love of books: Many authors of books dedicated a small prayer to Duztar for providing muse and craft to those of the pen, and even just from some of the intricate book covers that must have required extraordinary craftsmanship skill. Later on in his life, it would come to be that he learns the art of blacksmithing, and develops a deeper connection with Duztar. He was also very fond of stories related to Titanborn and their titanic lineage - always have been in awe of the mythical remains surrounding the village.

Klotan also unfolded to them the story of the V. in their full names, its significance, binding nature, and the story of the Titanborn that it came with - as well as passing on the warning.

The often-hidden V. in the family name stands for Voror. It is the name of a nomadic family of Titanborn , where their head is Voror the <SequenceNumber> and others are <Name> Vororson for the main branch of the family. The Voror nomadic family, 1500 years ago, had a dwelling close to the present whereabouts of Vakkengard and helped a contingent of Ashen Elf Fellintra refugees, that were being led by ancestors of Radegundh - the Duskember family, to settle within the area, as well as help drive out wild beasts. In exchange the Duskember family, as well as other ones, using their Wood Elf roots and knowledge aided the Titanborn by providing farming and 'green-thumb' advice and services (especially to obtain the most out of the extra fertile soil, as well as, to be able to successfully transfer some of this special soil to other areas for use on the nomadic family's travels). A bond was formed and the Voror family gave their name to the Duskember family, and a few others, to establish an eternal connection. All the Ashen elf families that were given this name were also given a Titanborn-sized signet ring with a Voror family rune and were also warned to not use the name when not needed, as the Voror family, being a large and well-spread one has old and new enemies. Throughout the ages, the bearers of V. and the Voror family Titanborn interacted quite a bit - some V.'s joining a group of Vorors to aid them with their farming wherever they settle, some pairs of V. and Voror causing trouble, some causing good, some forming new settlements in far away places - they could always call upon this bond. During the psionic war, the Voror Titanborn descended upon Titan's Rest and helped with protecting the village, which suffered considerable losses. Was it targeted due to the titanic remains? No one knows exactly if it was bad luck or not.

The Duskember main family - Radegundh's family - keep the signet ring in the basement of their residence. There are other Duskembers in the village. Klotan has 2 younger brothers (Joton and Sabotan) who live close by. They are also book traders and frequently the brothers travel together - there is safety in numbers. While both younger brothers keep a small collection of books at their homes, most of their collection is stored in the family library.

His sister, Marika, helped out with cooking and the farm, as well as being an extremely avid reader. After the passing of their mother, she took on the mother role for the family - doing most of the cooking and coordinating the farm work between them. Marika was a kind carer and teacher for Radegundh as well, and he loves her very much for this. As she grew older, Marika started to also give lessons to the village children, especially when Klotan was travelling for business, as Deron took care of the family as much as he could.

Radegundh was mostly a happy child until 6 - he studied books, the horn, and swordsmanship, and from 4 years old had a healthy interest in Titanborn. 4 years old is when he had his first experience of a Soul Dream (Dream of Fire Titanborn, more on each one later), living through a fragment of memory stored in his soul's composition - each dream following some sort of significant event, some good and some bad. The first one, at 4 years old, was during a small family vacation: Klotan, his father, had decided to take his wife and children to Bellmark's Landing on one of his book trading trips. On the first night of the ship trip, Radegundh was full of excitement and wonder - the first time ever outside the village, the first time on a ship, a growing sense of wonder - on that night, when he went to sleep, he drifted off into a Soul Dream. Part of his soul contains a fragment of a Fire Titanborn soul that lived ages prior - carrying on persisted memories through the soul, accessible via Soul Dreaming. He dove into a deep sleep and awoke late - but felt like Radegundh has lived through an entire day, in another time, in a very foreign place, from the perspective of someone else, someone large. His young mind could not process all that he saw, and even though his parents noted that Radegundh's stories were remarkably strange they did not put any more thought into it.

The death of his mother at age of 6 affected him a lot - not only did it trigger the second Soul Dream, but it showed him how cruel the world can be at an early age. From this event, Radegundh grew to dislike most of the Twelve even more. His prayers had fallen on deaf ears. With the second Dream and a growing appreciation and knowledge of Titanborn, an idea or dream started forming in his mind - "What if there is something else? The Titanborn pray to their ancestors and titanic lineage.. Why? Is there any boon to be gained from this? Did these beings of old reach divinity? A dependable guardian would be a blessing. A bulwark against trespassers from far and a kind giver to all, just as the soil in Titan's Rest is so generous!" These ideas were sowed into his mind from the history, stories and legends, germinated with the Soul Dreams and his mother's passing, and sprouted with age, knowledge and remembrance of the contents of the Soul Dreams, for he could not always remember all of the happenings of the dreams. However, strangely enough, after the second dream at age of 6, which he could not remember much of, Radegundh started recalling more details from his first dream from 2 years prior - a strange phenomenon.

Apart from this tragic event, Radegundh had a fairly happy childhood. He had cousins living close by to play with, a loving father and uncles, and a doting sister. He also loved sharing his favourite books and tales with the children that his father taught, apart from attending most of the lessons himself as well - unless he was needed to help with the house or farm duties (provided that he studied later on his own). One particular friend, and child of the neighbouring family, was closer to him than others and was called Godrus Cinderbark - same age. They frequently studied and played together, including matches of chess, as well as practised with wooden swords. His father was a carpenter: Godroy. Fellow ashen elves and holders of the V. initial. Their full names: Godroy and Godrus V. Cinderbark.

These two got into some trouble here and there - the culmination of which at 11 years of age when they wandered outside the village in an attempt to locate the spot where the Voror family of their V. initial fame resided all those years ago. What they managed to find instead were bandits who recognised them as residents from Vakkengard, who spared no effort to kidnap them for a possible monetary recompense from the fairly well of residents of the Titan's Rest. It would turn out that neither of the parties would come by their desired outcome; in a moment of confusion caused by Radegundh's rage induced shouting - for Radegundh always had a temper, forged and reforged from stories, legends, and life events - Godrus managed to steal a short sword from the side of a horse and free himself completely, and threw the sword to Radegundh, whom also proceeded to free himself. What followed next would impact their life forever - after freeing himself one of the bandits was closing in, this is when Radegundh plundged the sword in the assailant's stomach. Shock and confusion spread quickly - this allowed Godrus and Radegundh to run with all their might away, managing to hide in a near forest alluding detection from the pursuing bandits, until their fathers managed to locate them and drove away the delinquents. Whether Radegundh had ended a life or not, he was not sure, but that adrenaline rush from an active fight drove him into the third Soul Dream.

This dream showed him the landscape surrounding where the Titanborn lived. A land of strange buildings and mountain ranges, a view from a high point above his home - the peak of a volcano. Radegundh recounted his recallments to his father and sister, and this time - the third time - Klotan paid more notice to this, and recognised this as not mere dreams, but Soul Dreaming, the condition of remembrance of fragments of memories not belonging to one's own self, through the mixing and rebirth of souls. He explained this to Radegundh, and listened closer to the descriptions of what was witnessed through the eyes of a foregone Fire Titanborn. The style of the architecture reminded Klotan of what he read once from a briefly owned book recounting journeys in the East, in the Lands of Yamagato.

With sadness, Klotan had to explain that while the lands described are most likely in Yamagato, Titanborn have unfortunately been exterminated from that country a long time ago. No one knows why exactly - the TItanborn of Yamagato were renowned blacksmiths who created weapons and armor of wondrous design imbued with the rune-based method of magic of the Titanborn.

Radegundh uncontrollably cried at this sorrowful revelation, "Were they also failed by the gods? What happened to these Titanborn and their crafts? Why did the smallfolk of Yamagato exterminate the Titanborn?" In the aftermath of this understanding, Radegundh pleaded his father to buy him red hair dye on his next business trip to Bellmark's Landing - part of his soul was from these long-gone people, and he wanted to pay them honour and respect - especially to the man from whom's eyes he was viewing a different life: Kagu Kozuke.

From the day that his father returned with the dark ginger dye, Radegundh maintained a hair colour reminiscent of the some of the Titanborn. He also came to some realizations - Radegundh needed to train and learn more. This is when he started to keep a journal of everything that happened to him as well - especially anything that he remembers from his soul dreaming.
