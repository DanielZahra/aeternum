[Witch’s End](Witch%E2%80%99s%20End%2068ed9e9cc8924625ae221afa3ecc3747.md) was part of the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md) until [The Sixth Valkorian War](The%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%207e8a7ab94b6f4e708975b413257f16b2.md), where it was then surrendered to the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md) along side [Verdanport](Verdanport%20e2275b9adf7a4f0cb973c9b0cb42632c.md).

Witch’s End is a relatively dark town due to its placement within a Cavern. over time this attracted a lot of people from [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md) that for one reason or the other ended up [Valkoria](Valkoria%2063188c93864440e591a3528e50868ec6.md).

The town, has a dock as long as its length, as the sea trickles in till the end of the cavern. The lowest area, the dock, is where most trade, pubs, and shops are found. Underneath the dock, there are a large number of sewer like tunnels where the people of Witch’s End cultivate damp plants, medicines and fungi. The middle part of [Witch’s End](Witch%E2%80%99s%20End%2068ed9e9cc8924625ae221afa3ecc3747.md) end is where the majority of the population lives. The upper area houses the Catheral of Saint Shiva, and administrative builds in the witch’s end.

The walls of the cavern itself grow the Witch’s Fungus which is a delicacy for a lot of Valkorian gourmet.
