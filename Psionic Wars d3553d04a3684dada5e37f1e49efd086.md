Creatures from the Far Plane invaded the material worlds. Several armies and heroes from different cultural, race and social standing united to fight them back. The battle was won but a huge cost. History has marked this period between 2630-2647 NA as the **Psionic War**.

The entire material plane was involved in this war and the casualties and destruction were great. The remains of the war are sometimes mentioned up to this day and some of the damage was not reversible.

The invasion resulted in a large change within the planes. Some of the warrior slaves that were brought from far away have remained with the people of the planes. Some friendly, others not so much.

The Psionic powers have left some of the people in Aeternum capable of extra ordinary feats of the mind.
