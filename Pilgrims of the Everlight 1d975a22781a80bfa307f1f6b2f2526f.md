The [Pilgrims of the Everlight](Pilgrims%20of%20the%20Everlight%201d975a22781a80bfa307f1f6b2f2526f.md) are a group formed to spread light to the darkest corners of Aeternum. There is a large concentration of their members that live in the cavers of underground [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md). They make it their job to patrol and travel and create long lasting sources if light for other travellers to use as a beacon. 

While the majority of the pilgrims are members of the clergy of the twelve, any person can join the pilgrims and dedicated any time to the cause.

The pilgrims were formed by the sect of the church that focuses on [Solas (God of Light)](Solas%20(God%20of%20Light)%20015540f7a3384a6183587703a171a5f7.md).
