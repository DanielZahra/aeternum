### Summary

- These Elemental creatures called Spirits are known to wander between the realms and can be pulled through by conjuration magic.
- Their spiritual nature doesn't allow them to distinguish one mortal from the other so they will usually burn anything that moves.

### Abilities

- Their bodies are on fire, so attacking them with melee weapons is always a problem.
- They are susceptible to water damage.
