# Order of the Ascended

This order, unlike the other orders is mostly a secret sect of the church. The Ascended are a group of 12 people that are anointed by the leaders of the church.

Each one of these Ascended represents a singular god, one of the twelve. And there can ever only be 12 of them.

The Ascended are only called for the biggest and most dangerous problems in the planes. They are often the strongest and best equipped forces of the church and each one of the Ascended is worth an army of knights. The Ascended are usually called in when diplomacy, intimidation or the other orders cannot contain or deal with a problem. 

The Ascended operate outside of the laws of any sovereign country and also those of the church and are often allowed to make their own decision. 

When an asecended member dies or retires, they are replaced by a hand picked group of the churchâ€™s leaders.
