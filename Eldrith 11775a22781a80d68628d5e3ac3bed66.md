A Psionic Eldrith

The alien Eldrith is recorded in history as the invaders that led the [Psionic](Psionic%208302f0efd60244b1be7a22191f32ac32.md) during the [Psionic Wars](Psionic%20Wars%20d3553d04a3684dada5e37f1e49efd086.md). 

Their kind was almost wiped out from Aeternum from the few straggles that remained manage to reform and stick around.

### Physical

Their bodies have the appearance of a weak biped, with a large brain, pupilless crimson eyes and arms that are usually around 1 to 1.2 meters long. The weakness is the result of their Psionic powers, which allow them to control most things with their minds. IN battle their bodies are reinforced with psionic powers both as armor and weapons.

### Psionic Powers

The power to control, suggest, enslave, and dominate allowed the [Eldrith](Eldrith%2011775a22781a80d68628d5e3ac3bed66.md) to conquer many people and worlds. There does not seem to be a limit to their Psionic power.

### Reproduction

An [Eldrith](Eldrith%2011775a22781a80d68628d5e3ac3bed66.md) can create an other [Eldrith](Eldrith%2011775a22781a80d68628d5e3ac3bed66.md) by invading another [Folk](https://www.notion.so/Folk-11775a22781a80eaa8e9f02f4fbde98a?pvs=21)â€™s body and mind. The process takes up to a year (depending on the power of the [Eldrith](Eldrith%2011775a22781a80d68628d5e3ac3bed66.md) and the resolve of their traget) of psionic tampering but eventually everyone succumbs to the process.

The result is a newly born [Eldrith](Eldrith%2011775a22781a80d68628d5e3ac3bed66.md) without any connection to their previous life. This is as close as this species has to family. Ultimately the [Eldrith](Eldrith%2011775a22781a80d68628d5e3ac3bed66.md) almost all crave for power and the only reason they reproduce is if they fear death or extinction. Otherwise, they easily see others of their kind as competition.
