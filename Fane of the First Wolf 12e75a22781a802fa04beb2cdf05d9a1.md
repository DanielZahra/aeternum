# Fane of the First Wolf

This abandoned shrine is believed to be the place where the first [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) of the Wolf was born. Initially, it used to be a den and over time people gathered and built a full shrine around the den which is a sacred place for the people of the [Covenant of the Wolf](Covenant%20of%20the%20Wolf%2012575a22781a80d99e01f30949cd5c3f.md).

The First Wolf and [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md), whose name is lost to history, but often referred to as Kannon by the peolpe of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md).

As time passes the people of [Mz’Lupakku](Mz%E2%80%99Lupakku%2012575a22781a8030a6b3ef34e94fc9b3.md) moved a bit further away from the Fane and eventually it fell into a bit of despair when the entrance collapsed. The Wardens still visit and maintain the shrine from the insides and every time a new group of Wardens are met with their [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md), it is the custom to send them to the ‘abandoned’ shrine and test them. The knowledge that the Fane is still active only belongs to the Wardens.

The first spirit guardian is believed to have appeared around 2500NA (Around 7 centuries ago).

The Fane which now acts is the testing ground of new Wardens consists of 5 sections, each of the section is meant to test both the Wardens and also the new [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) but also to teach them some of the important history of how the [Covenant of the Wolf](Covenant%20of%20the%20Wolf%2012575a22781a80d99e01f30949cd5c3f.md) came to be.

- The Foyer and the old Den, which is always locked with a door needing 4 discs, each of the magical discs that are placed within the other 4 sections. The current Wardens are in charge of preparing this test for the new teams.
    - These discs must be placed in the right chronological order for the door to open.
    - Once inserted these discs open the way to the original den of the first wolf.
    - Usually, one of the current wardens will set a trap and challenge the wardens to combat to see if their training has made them worthy of protecting the [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md).
- Mesa’s Heights
    - The Oldest and First Disc
    - The Mesa’s heights, section of the shrine rests on the edge of the mesa which has collapsed over time.
    - A large part of it is actually on the outside of the mesa’s face and a wrong slip might send somebody falling down the mesa’s side.
    - The heights have a large population of flittermice
    - A spirit of one of the very first wardens still lingers here bound to the shrine itself, and he usually is given the tiask.
        - He communicates through a hookah and  story of a group of Sylfkin to ventured at the top of the mesa while it was filled with the mist, and one can see them protecting a baby wolf.
- The Old Treasury
    - The treasury is mostly sunken underwater from the Lupakku Lake. The Disc here is meant to be the first disc in the sequence.
    - The water here has had a family of Dreadfins that are very dangerous and will anything that moves in their water.
    - The area tests the greed of the Wardens or their willing ness to take risks to acquire what they want.
    - There are several traps, where the current Wardens reactivate them and place treasures within.
    - The Mural at the end of this section is placed on the roof and is activated from a pool of water, revealing the Disc on the roof.
        - The story of this section, reveals how the early people who came to this mesa built their homes and eventually founded Mz’Lupakku as it is known today. It is clear that they came together here but are from different background and places.
- Path of the Brave
    - The third disc is meant to be placed in the path of the brave.
    - This section of the Fane, has had the roofs come crashing down due to the roots from the trees above.
    - This is a dangerous section with the ceiling not being stable but also because it is inhabited by a savage pack of Ratroaches.
    - The Mural at the end is placed in a section where the Rat Roaches always leave their nests with babies.
        - While most might argue that the Wardens could show compassion, the brave will do what it takes to get the job done and it is fully expected of the new Wardens to also eliminate the young of the Rat Roaches.
        - The Mural itself, details the formation of the [Covenant of the Wolf](Covenant%20of%20the%20Wolf%2012575a22781a80d99e01f30949cd5c3f.md) as [Spirit Guardian](Spirit%20Guardian%2012475a22781a808d9aa0c2bac0158cad.md) and Wardens going on the Journey of the searing and coming back stronger and enlightened allowing the rest of the Covenant to benefit from their journey.
- Sepulcher of the Wardens (4th)
    - The 4th Disc is in the sepulcher of the wardens
    - This large catacomb has the remains of the wardens, those who want to be interred here, and their bones are left to be used to test new wardens against the dangers of the mists.
    - Walking the catacombs the new Wardens will usually find themselves fighting a set of undead skeletons in a pincer attack.
    - instead of a mural this room holds a stone book pedestal, with small but detailed writing, mentioning ‘After succeeding on the searing, living a full life and training the next generation of Wardens, there is a place for any warden that wishes to rest next to the first wolf’
        - When read outload a disc is exposed within a section of the stone pedestal.
