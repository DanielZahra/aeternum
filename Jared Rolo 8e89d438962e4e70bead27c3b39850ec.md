### Summary

Coming from a long line of Cartographers and a descendent of [Magnus Rolo](Magnus%20Rolo%205353ac936f8748439cbb90822674d7f5.md). Jared’s main interest was to travel around Aeternum and map as much of it as possible.

Joined the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) as a novice with the hopes to climb in the ranks and manage to make the best maps in Aeternum.

### Appearance and Personality

A quiet, polite and respectful man, with an eye for detail. He has an acute fear of monsters and fighting in general and tries to stay out of trouble. 

However, he’s not against going into trouble to explore and find new places.

### Skills, Abilities and Possessions

He always carries a full set and backups of cartography gear to make sure he can map everything he can see.

### **Relationships and History**

In 3213 NA he joined the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) when they were preparing to set out for a long journey at sea towards the [Black Lagoon](Black%20Lagoon%2003d6c0c76ea54a41b63c3bcc2245e2d9.md).

Having stayed in [Shi-rai Igarashi](Shi-rai%20Igarashi%202b00fac466024354b0273317d2e43ca0.md)’s group he kept working with him and learning more about mapping, and chasing his goal of creating an updated map of [Runaria](Runaria%2013a9b9a7f3ee4868a3a851155c4ea24b.md) and perhaps, beyond. 

He moved to [Dawnsreach](Dawnsreach%20761cae0d1e6a43e2ae73a08f7d6fc2ce.md) with the rest of the [Quills of Ios](Quills%20of%20Ios%206a92bc4f5c7c4629a25e19d47d321171.md) that were in [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md).
