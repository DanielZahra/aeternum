### Summary

Situated in the heart of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md), on [Valkorian’s Seat](Valkorian%E2%80%99s%20Seat%20eb373989a5ab4abcaae4c4f0264b3656.md). [Dawnsreach](Dawnsreach%20761cae0d1e6a43e2ae73a08f7d6fc2ce.md) is a newfound city and being given treatment as almost the capital of the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md) as it was found right after the [End of the Sixth Valkorian War](End%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%20baaa265f20174631be11e4821e2552ba.md). In March of 3214, a large expedition of [Silver Eagles](Silver%20Eagles%20eda02d5b743247b1996ab7388b532bb2.md) and [Ink and Quill](Ink%20and%20Quill%209db8e46e649845c3bd0040362636498e.md) with the help of the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md), found the remains of an old abandoned city filled with [Forgotten](Forgotten%2006e3b3ba9eb349538fd9eec617dc7e58.md). This was probabaly the home of [Valkorian Sunstriker](Valkorian%20Sunstriker%20022238d5c0024e84a1aa88a05af19c06.md) a few centuries before. It wa situated at the top of a cliff overseeing the Inner Valkorian sea. A perfect location to run trade and have the most accessible port. 

The city it self needed some work, but people and immigrants moved in droves to settle in this new land with promise of a better life. The housing was sold extremely cheap as it was all abandoned and needed repair.

[Dawnsreach](Dawnsreach%20761cae0d1e6a43e2ae73a08f7d6fc2ce.md) got its name from the first time the city itself saw some proper light after centuries of magical fog covering all of its streets. [Calliope Lightseeker](Calliope%20Lightseeker%200d801d6e7a9e48979700aa3b30c2462d.md) moved away from [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) and took the seat of representative for the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md) for Dawnsreach.

This city is still young and many are gunning for it to be the biggest commerce center in Valkoria.

### History

Nestled within the heart of the city, under the Temple of the Twelve, the remains of an ancient teleportation gate were found. These were slowly and carefully brought up to the surface and rebuilt as the first and only Teleportation gate within the [Valkorian City-States](Valkorian%20City-States%2094cc103e39aa4dc4a9e2e08376851195.md).
