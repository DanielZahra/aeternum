# Underforge

The [Underforge](Underforge%2018675a22781a8049898fd09aa61c74c8.md) is the opposite of [Skyforge](Skyforge%2018675a22781a8045ba28c6b7ac145041.md). This heavy industrial area is where the poorest people live. Rife with gangs, criminals and some would say almost a lawless part of the city.  The underforge serves as a massive underbelly for [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md).

Most people try to avoid the Underforge mainly as there are a lot of gangs that will often fight in the streets. unfortunately the [Emberguard](Emberguard%2018275a22781a806cb27adda3a65bbad1.md)â€™s presence is not as strong in this district.

### Notable Places [Underforge](Underforge%2018675a22781a8049898fd09aa61c74c8.md)

[The Pits](The%20Pits%2018675a22781a803bbf99fe61894e030e.md) 

[The Pits](The%20Pits%2018675a22781a803bbf99fe61894e030e.md) is the quasi wasteland that is found at the bottom is [Emberdeep](Emberdeep%20970b2a8371ba4facad9c16f1a552038e.md) right at the bottom of the [Underforge](Underforge%2018675a22781a8049898fd09aa61c74c8.md). Any rubbish, material, or bodies thrown from the edges of the city goes tumbling town into the Pit. This scorching boiling area is a rancid wasteland after centuries of people from Emberdeep throwing things off the sides of the city. The downtrodden will often rummage around the pit to try and find things to pawn off for some coin. more often than not, they will find themselves victim to one of the many monsters that live down here.
