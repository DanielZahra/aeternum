### Realm Tear

When the Eternals were reaching their peak of power, they dabbled to far in the magic of reality and they unleashed the Void. The Realm Team was a mythic spell that was cast by The Twelve when they unravelled the fabric of reality and thus holding back the void but at the same time undoing their own universe, but giving birth to a new one, the one we now know as Aeternum. How this magic works and what it did is unknown, but the sheer amount of power needed for such devastation cannot be imagined by 'modern' standards of magic, physics, or alchemy.
