### Summary

Coming from a long line of families that make fine port wine. (the De Fonseca), Florina has had a comfortable upbringing as a rich citizen of the empire. She got involved in politics pretty early and eventually made her way as a Praetor for [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md). She was known to be cunning and ruthless but also business minded and she helped turn the city of [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) into a very profitable hub for the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md).

### **Relationships and History**

During her term as Preator, she was brought the Prince of the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md), [Cameron Mavis](Cameron%20Mavis%205658a635029e430cb235619939f851eb.md) and Florina was the one deciding and also responsible for making sure his death would be a show.

Little did she know that this would backfire, as the people were sick of this and revolted. She did not have many allies in this and the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) ‘s main troops did not even get to [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) in time as the people of the city took over.

The people were ready to burn her house down with her in it, but the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) changed this outcome. If she had to return to the empire she would be executed.

She’s being held under house arrest in [Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) and acting as a ‘advisor’ to the new council.

During the [End of the Sixth Valkorian War](End%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Valkorian%20War%20baaa265f20174631be11e4821e2552ba.md), Queen [Elizabeth Mavis](Elizabeth%20Mavis%2019481c93fdc84fcb865c764143487a9e.md), of the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md) requested that [Florina De Fonseca](Florina%20De%20Fonseca%20857fc3a6d5fa45e6ad0b12519d0264b1.md) be delivered as a prisoner for causing the death of her son and husband. Following this, [Florina De Fonseca](Florina%20De%20Fonseca%20857fc3a6d5fa45e6ad0b12519d0264b1.md) was publically executed for the people of [Isyen Lenora](Isyen%20Lenora%2025a3a780df3043f187093c732b6f279d.md) to sate some of their vengeance against the [Palantine Empire](Palantine%20Empire%20b5f0a5e7621b4b02862738a0582cfccd.md) while the war slowed down.
