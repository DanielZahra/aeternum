### Summary

An honorable man who lived most of his life as a young clan chief of the Hangetsu Village.  Most of his work was overshadowed by the red mire, a haunted swamp close to the village. 

Luckily for Koga, the [Midnight Note](Midnight%20Note%20aabd4488c4ea43c393d10542ec8af339.md) visited his clan and used the occasion to deal with the creature that inhabited the red mire. A Fiendish witch that turned people to stone and stoned their memories.

Kogaâ€™s main role moving forward is to rebuild and strengthen his position among the clans

### Appearance and Personality

A Calm and Smart man. Very pious and spiritual in his way. His appearance is somewhat brutish but this never lasts once he is engaged in diplomatic conversations.
