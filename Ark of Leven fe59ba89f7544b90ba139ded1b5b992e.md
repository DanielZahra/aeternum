### Summary

Formed in the year 2710 NA, the legendary dwarven pirate Dario Leven owned too many ships but he did not want to lose sight of any of them. Greed was the main culprit but slowly, he started connecting the ships together, adding more and more each day. The ships could, of course, could remove the connection and sail together or apart, they stayed in the same spots for sometimes months as they formed a society around Leven's biggest ship, the [Ark of Leven](Ark%20of%20Leven%20fe59ba89f7544b90ba139ded1b5b992e.md) .

It is said that the Ark still houses Leven's treasure from his pirating days, but Leven's Ark is now a 'legitimate business and probably the most successful shipping and transportation company in [Runaria](Runaria%2013a9b9a7f3ee4868a3a851155c4ea24b.md) and [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md) 

The current leader of Leven's Ark is [Uleryn of the Deeps](Uleryn%20of%20the%20Deeps%204d60deafabe24f8787440a3e81098ea5.md) , has been increasing the size of the Floating City by quite a big margin following her predecessor’s. Accepting rather strange payments in the form of people and calling them sea gifted. Nobles, merchants and sometimes rulers offered their children in exchange for the services of Leven's Ark and the price to pay was handing over children. Which then are trained to become the best seafarers in the planes. These people are known as the [Children of Leven](Children%20of%20Leven%2030e9783ada974b4585cd6c5222c05939.md), a lot of people dislike these methods but most countries rely on them to move things overseas so it's best not to interfere.

These people’s main goal is to trade and rule the seas as the most skilled sailers in the worlds.
