# Cerulean Leviathan

Tags: Water

### Summary

These gargantuan beasts live in the open waters of Cerulia. Those that risk their lives to steal their young and raise them through generations will be awarded for a creature that lives centuries and outlives many of its captors or 'guides'.

These guides are skilled individuals who learn how to take care of a Leviathan, guide and teach it how to accommodate people in its insides while it travels through the water.

These creatures are very flexible and friendly, they can hold their breaths for weeks. These strange rooms are prepared for the passengers called 'Silos' which the Leviathans learn to place in their mouth and travel with them making the journey easy and as comfortable as possible while being in the mouth of the creature.

The Silos are released in the Ocean while the guide works with the creature to swallow easily and place them in a good place within it's flexible jaw.
