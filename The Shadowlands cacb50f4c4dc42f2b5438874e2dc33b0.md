Not much is known about this place except that it is almost always dark as if swallowed by the [Tenebrium (Plane of Darkness)](Tenebrium%20(Plane%20of%20Darkness)%207718024e47414800b2c2b6077c344e7d.md)  and itâ€™s infested with undead.

**Shadowlands**, the dark no man's land said to be inhabited by undead and shadowy monstrosities. Legends say nobody journies into the Shadowlands and make it out. There is no proper record of what is in there nor how long it has been this way.

Whispers call the leader here the King of Shadows.
