# Copper Alley

Previously known as ‘The Ditch’, this area was burnt down in the [[Bellmark’s Landing](Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%2054c76e237a3b470da0856b090bec2ee2.md) Independence](@Bellmark%E2%80%99s%20Landing%20Independence%20465ff1794f144d8f9f5368c2bc9ef69b.md). Named the Copper Alley as the [Copper Rats](Copper%20Rats%2080dc3a7e773e4b7f97ceadc9f93ace8c.md) were mostly involved in the rebuilding and they were the ones that lived here prior to the event. 

The funding came from the city’s coffers as [Pedro Barille](Pedro%20Barille%2060d0f65f2fd5457f905e2cc3ea085d3c.md), had managed to get a seat in the new council.
