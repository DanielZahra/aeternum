The Dream Realm is also known as the Dreamscape or the Anima Realm, is where the imagination of most sentient beings visits when they are dreaming. It is magical in nature and also part of the [Ethereal Plane](Ethereal%20Plane%20b1f9605fddc34e65ba11ce458e0e6c97.md).

### Dream or Nightmares?

In a similar fashion to the Ethereal Plane, the dream realms exists within and around all the other planes at the same time as everything else.

The mind and souls of creatures that are able to dream mingle in their place and allow their anima to take over.

If Physical creatures or Dreamers do control and manage to visit the Dream Realm, they can hurt the mind and bodies of those visiting. Of course, physicality is a tiny aspect of what happens in the Dream Realm and everything is controlled by the mind, the more powerful, the easier it is to bend the realm in your favor.

The Dream Realms took a radical change in the Psionic War when a large number of aberrations fled into the realms when they could not return to the far planes.

### Creatures

Sometimes the realm of Dream is also called the realms of nightmares as the creatures that dwell within are created from the dreams of living beings, except they can bleed into reality and said nightmarish creatures become very real and sometimes dangerous.
