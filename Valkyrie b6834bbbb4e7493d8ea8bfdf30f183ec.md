# Valkyrie

Tags: Ethereal

### Summary

Valkyries are almost like cryptid creatures that people mentioned but no real proof of them being real exists. People have painted them as ghostly faceless feminine figures with light armor, black wings and white hair, clothing.

Floating around their beings are always 2 giant crescent slicers.

Legend has it that they reside with the spirit realm and listen in closely to those who play to [Graav (God of Death)](Graav%20(God%20of%20Death)%20d63b83eee74f4e1c9db355255ee1a0a0.md)’s tone. When a creature makes a wrong step, gets cursed, pulls a wrong card, or pisses off the right person, they might end up as a target for Valkyries.

Some see the Valkryie as a savior, others as an evil being but it would seem that they as Ethereal beings with neither inclination.

### Abilities

Valkyries can slice the rift with their weapons and open a gateway between the Ethereal Plane and other planes. They usually hunt folk of the realm and drag them into the spirit realm eventually ushering their souls to the soul cycle. Often the souls of those killed by a Valkyrie are enslaved in the form of [Reaping Spirits](Reaping%20Spirits%2011975a22781a8017aa37de7efcabb9f5.md).

Their true form is hard to see and usually appears to be a harmless spiritual wisp.
