# Associated with the plane of light and hence the light throughout the day, Solas is sometimes depicted with a chiseled face of a man, hard at work in the light of day. The farmers of the realm rely on Solas's 'power' to grow the crops and feed their family. People find safety in light and also adventurers pray to him for clear skies as the light allows them to explore this wonderful world. On the other hand, the creatures that do not do well in the light usually despise the name of Solas and curse him.
