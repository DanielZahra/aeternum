From the largest fleet ever launched to explore the lost titan, only a handful of people have returned, and none of the ships. The mysterious land turned out to be a death trap where escape was difficult, food was scarce and the weather itself swallowed anything that tried to leave by sea.

Though either sheer luck or stubborn bravery a small group of mercenaries managed to breakthrough the mysteries and turn off a device that kept the islands locked in the temporal rift of weather. They teleported themselves and a few survivors out. Within days it was reported that the Lost Titan has been surrounded by the temporal temptest again, leaving a lot of questions unanswered and also more adventuring types wanting to try to explore the land again, this time with some knowledge of what to expect.
