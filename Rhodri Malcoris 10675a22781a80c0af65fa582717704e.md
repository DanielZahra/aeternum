### Summary

This battle hardened Xifajk has spent many years working in Valkoria, mostly disguised as an Orc. he worked to train the [Queendom of Nya’Tallin](Queendom%20of%20Nya%E2%80%99Tallin%20cd93d0f7f358493288358dfc3baef5b6.md) special forces with fighting and handling dangerous fiends when they go out of control.

He has a moniker as ‘the wingless’ as he was captured by a Lycian troop who tortured him and ripped off his wings, but made the mistake of not realizing he doesn’t need a weapon to shred them to bits. He also has a prosthetic metal leg, none knows what happened and how he ended up with a missing leg. 

He’s light-hearted and very different from the rest of his family who are very focused on being the richest family in Darkmmor.

He’s the first cousin of [Morgan Malcoris](Morgan%20Malcoris%209cb14b1e76e0411e836ed195220e795c.md) the Head of [Malcoris Family](Malcoris%20Family%2041638d15596c4c69914115100a4d2836.md).
