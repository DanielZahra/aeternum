# Risen

Most dead people should in theory stay dead. However somewhere in [The Shadowlands](The%20Shadowlands%20cacb50f4c4dc42f2b5438874e2dc33b0.md), an unknown magic brought the spark of life within some [Forgotten](Forgotten%2006e3b3ba9eb349538fd9eec617dc7e58.md) people. The forgotten have been around forever, however they were always mindless and considered nothing more than monsters.

The [Risen](Risen%20e28f5205b526454a9cdc49db3e3619d7.md) are different, once [Forgotten](Forgotten%2006e3b3ba9eb349538fd9eec617dc7e58.md) but now reborn into a new life, they are ‘babies’ born into the bodies of fallen people. They moatly keep to themselves and live within the [The Shadowlands](The%20Shadowlands%20cacb50f4c4dc42f2b5438874e2dc33b0.md) in [Kas’Velar](Kas%E2%80%99Velar%20476c9e227f2443eca550f0ab8be45af5.md) under the vigilance of the [Cassius Valentine](Cassius%20Valentine%20cc019b58e37c4b3cb130607436022928.md) the King of Shadows.

Unlike the [Forgotten](Forgotten%2006e3b3ba9eb349538fd9eec617dc7e58.md), the Risen do not live forever in their rotting corpses, once the spark of life enters the bodies, it does eventually expire and then the body can be used to ‘birth’ a new [Risen](Risen%20e28f5205b526454a9cdc49db3e3619d7.md).

The magic used to bring the Risen to ‘life’ can be considered a curse of sorts, applied via utilisation of magic forbidden by the church.
