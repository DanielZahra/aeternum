# Cartwright Mining Company

Tags: Cerulia

This company is a family-owned business. A Dwarven family known as the Cartwrights developed and built a magnificent way to move in the underground of [Cerulia](Cerulia%208fad80600fff487ab3fd9d21ef4f94c7.md). Up to this day, their network of rails is expanding.

The ‘Carts’ built by the CMC, are known as the ‘Singing Wheels’, this comes from a special alloy of steel the family uses to build the wheels of their carts. This alloy, known as Vibranium or Singing Metal, is created with such a wavelength that it can propel a cart forward or backward when riding on rails. Of course, this only works with several, very skilled drivers that know how to ‘tune’ the metal and make it sing or vibrate and thus move the cart.

The CMC started out working from a small area which developed into the city of [Railforge](Railforge%20636860fcabe440b085c251c97af3d2b0.md).

They protect the secret of making Vibranium closely and aggressively. 

The Company traces its lineage to many centuries ago and they have been managing the rails for as long as they remember.
